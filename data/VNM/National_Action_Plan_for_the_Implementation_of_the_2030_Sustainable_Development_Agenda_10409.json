It requires the mobilization of all resources of society, the strengthened coordination between ministries, sectors, localities, institutions, mass and social organizations, businesses and other stakeholders which will together contribute to the successful implementation of the sustainable development goals by the year 2030.\n* People are at the center of sustainable development. Efforts will be made to maximize the role of people as the main actors, the main resource and the goal of sustainable development; to increasingly meet the material and spiritual needs of all the strata of people; and to build a country that is prosperous and a society that is democratic, just and civilized and an economy that is both independent and proactive in international integration to achieve national sustainable development.\n* Attention will be paid to creating enabling conditions for all the people and communities in society to have equal opportunities for development, to access common resources, to participate in, contribute to and benefit from development, and to create a strong, healthy material, intellectual and cultural foundation for future generations. Efforts will be made to leave no one behind and to prioritize those population who are most difficult to access, including children, women, the elderly, the poor, the handicapped, , people in isolated and remote regions and other vulnerable groups.\n* Science and technology will constitute a foundation and driving force for national sustainable development.
