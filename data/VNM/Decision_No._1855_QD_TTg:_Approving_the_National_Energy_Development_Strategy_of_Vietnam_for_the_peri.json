The Strategy states that renewable energy forms are not yet sufficiently assessed and so provides a mandate for further research into potential for exploitation. It also specifically mentions use of propaganda on the use of renewable energy sources in remote areas.<br />\n<br />\nThe Strategy also states the goal of integrating the use of renewable energies into energy saving programmes and other national target programmes, including programmes of rural electrification, forest plantations, hunger eradication and poverty alleviation. Furthermore the strategy gives priority to development of renewable energy, bio-energy and nuclear power. It specifies that by 2050, nuclear electricity will account for about 15-20% of total commercial energy consumption."}
