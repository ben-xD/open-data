This includes favourable tax mechanisms; concessional loans and (unspecified) land use rights to investors in biofuel production. Between 2007 and 2015, biofuels are classified as eligible for special investment incentives, including tax exemption or reduction.<br />\n<br />\nThe Decision also encourages research and development in the field and the 'mastery' and development of the relevant technologies. Specific activities to achieve this include technology transfer and sending scientific and technological personnel to countries with a developed biofuel production industry for professional training of 6-12 months. The final elements of the Decision refer to the institutional issues and assigns responsibilities for specific tasks involved in implementation and organisation to Ministries.<br />\n<br />\nThe decision includes the target that by 2010, Vietnam will develop various models of trial production, specifically 100,000 tonnes of E5 and 50,000 tonnes of B5. By 2015 the output of ethanol and vegetable oils will reach 250,000 tonnes. The vision to 2025 is to have achieved advanced level technology in the sector and for ethanol and vegetable output to reach 1.8m tonnes, c. 5% of gasoline and oil demand (unspecified whether current demand or projected level of demand)."}
