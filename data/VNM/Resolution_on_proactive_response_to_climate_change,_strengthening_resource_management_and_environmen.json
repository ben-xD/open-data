The resolution promotes the shift towards a model of green growth (see the below Green Growth Strategy). This involves restructuring the economy towards sustainable development. The resolution also seeks to create favorable conditions for businesses to invest in green growth, with the government mandated to establish the legal framework and build specific policies to support business."}
