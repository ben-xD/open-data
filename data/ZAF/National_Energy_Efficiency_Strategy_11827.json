The <a href=\"http://www.lse.ac.uk/GranthamInstitute/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/EE_Strategy_ZAF.pdf\">National Energy Efficiency Strategy (2016)</a>, only released as a draft, aims to further stimulate energy efficiency improvements, achieved through the energy efficiency strategy from 2005, through a combination of fiscal and financial incentives, and enabling measures. It expects to achieve and economy-wide reduction of 29% in final energy consumption. The document has 7 sections, the first three present the policy's background and objectives, then it presents the country's energy consumption profile and the opportunities for energy savings, then it presents goals and targets for specific sectors (i.e. residential, transports...) and finally how to achieve these goals."}
