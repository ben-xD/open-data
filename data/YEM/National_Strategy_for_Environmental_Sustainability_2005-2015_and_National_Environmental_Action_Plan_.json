More recent surveys have demonstrated that there are at least six discrete areas where coral communities are developed along the Gulf of Aden coast - concentrated from the entrance to the Red Sea to Aden in the west, and from Belhaf to Al Mukalla in the east.  Coral diversity is higher to the west of Al Mukalla where there are approximately 40 genera.  East of this point growth is limited to isolated colonies of a few genera, principally the more hardy or massive forms such as Stylophora, Porites and various faviids, a finding echoed by studies in southern Oman.  Low sea water temperatures associated with upwellingand competition for light from algae probably limit growth while grazing by urchins and herbivorous fish are important in determining larval settlement rates.  Generally, coral communities in the Yemeni Gulf of Aden grow as a veneer over a rocky substrate of inorganic origin, usually discernible between colonies.  Thus these are coral communities rather than true reefs.  Cold water upwelling and the limited distribution of available habitat are the two principal factors which limit coral diversity and growth in the area, although other factors such as turbidity and scouring also may be important.  Along the north-west Gulf of Aden coast, key sites include Khor Umairah; Crater, Aden; Shuara; Belhaf; Bir Ali and Offshore Islands; Broum; Al Mukalla; Ras Fartak and Ras Fanta."}, {"text_block_id": "p41_b316", "text": "1.7.3.

Public expenditures during the three years of the PRS were prepared under the macroeconomic framework of the strategy that strives to achieve high and increasing economic growth rates within a sustainable fiscal policy in the medium and long-terms and in the light of estimated external financing and the absorptive capacity of the economy.  Furthermore, the need to increase expenditure allocations for the social sectors and infrastructure was taken into consideration to contribute towards poverty reduction.  The forecasts of the PRS are built on an expected decline in oil revenues, increased non-oil revenues and rationalization of public expenditures to minimum growth levels to ensure containment of the fiscal deficit.  Total current government revenues (including grants) are expected to decline in the coming three years to reach 29.5 per cent of GDP by the end of the PRS period as a result of the expected decline in oil and gas revenues from 20.3 per cent of GDP in 2003 to 16.2 per cent by 2005.  The policy of the Government of Yemen for revenue mobilization and development, particularly for non-oil revenues, is based on the most efficient utilization of available economic resources and adjustment of the tariffs for public services using economic foundations.  The Government worked developing the tax system through the applying the Generalized Sales Tax (GST) and raising the efficiency of tax administration and collection.  On the public expenditure side, the medium-term expenditure framework reflects the adoption of the policy of expenditure restraints in the light of expected decline in government revenues. In particular, current expenditures are projected to decline from 28.2 per cent of GDP in 2003 to 25.4 per cent in 2005 despite the expected increases in wages and salaries, goods and services, maintenance and operations, and debt services, while transfers and subsidy allocations are expected to decline sharply. These indicators reflect government effort to raise the efficiency of the civil service, retrenchment of excess public sector employees, reducing masked unemployment while raising salaries and wages for employees in the administrative apparatus of the State in addition to rationalization of spending on non-developmental activities. It is expected that, given the above-projected expenditures and revenues, a fiscal deficit will be realized throughout the three years of the PRS being careful that it not reach unsafe limits, i.e., not more than 4 per cent of GDP in 2004.  The budget was also based on the fact the deficit will be financed from real sources to avoid any inflationary pressures caused by deficit financing. The fiscal framework includes a continuous increase in development expenditure reaching 7.8 per cent of GDP in 2005.
