Non-economic loss and damage results from the impairment to those thingsthat are generally not traded in markets and are thus difficult to quantify or price. 36 Examples of non-economic losses include impacts on life, health, mobility, territory, biodiversity, ecosystem services,indigenous knowledge, cultural heritage, sense of place and social cohesion. 37 Both types of loss anddamage can be caused by slow onset or extreme weather events and can be either attributed directlyor indirectly to climate change. For instance, sea level rise that results in the loss of mangroves, thedegradation of fish habitats and the eventual decline in commercially important fisheries could beconsidered an example of an economic loss indirectly caused by climate change. However, loss of lifeas a result of a high-intensity hurricane could be considered a non-economic loss directly attributableto climate change."}, {"text_block_id": "p95_b7", "text": "Improve knowledge and communication products, services,platforms, networks to raise awareness on fisheries, aquacultureand climate change for risk reduction action"}, {"text_block_id": "p94_b7", "text": "160 Design a programme to build the capacity of fishermen to identifyfishing grounds (e.g. sharing fish ground mapping; training on GPSuse and training on safe night fishing) to reduce fuel use, increaseand diversify production"}, {"text_block_id": "p93_b7", "text": "Facilitation"}, {"text_block_id": "p91_b7", "text": "Emergency systems and infrastructure for food storage, packaging,processing, food import and distribution to cover food shortagesduring emergencies established and operational."}, {"text_block_id": "p90_b7", "text": "Facilitation"}, {"text_block_id": "p89_b7", "text": "144 Design and implement national programme or a system topromote Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) of the privatesector (e.g. Adopt a Community)"}, {"text_block_id": "p88_b7", "text": "Irrigation systems with high water efficiency and water-conservingtechnologies assessed, developed, installed, operational and scaledup."}, {"text_block_id": "p87_b7", "text": "Adaptation measuresIndicative outputsAlignment with theCCAP138 Adopt a watershed management planning approach for zoning(e.g. within agroforestry system)"}, {"text_block_id": "p86_b7", "text": "Facilitation andImplementation"}, {"text_block_id": "p85_b7", "text": "130 Adopt CRA best practices to extend the use of soil and water andenergy-efficient conservation measures (mulching, appropriateterracing, drip irrigation, solar pump, wind power, etc.) toreduce water losses and erosion"}, {"text_block_id": "p84_b7", "text": "reduce operation cost tested and promoted."}, {"text_block_id": "p83_b7", "text": "- Study to identify and protect vulnerable agricultural speciesconducted- Programme to establish in-situ and ex-situ conservation measuresfor vulnerable agricultural species developed and executed."}, {"text_block_id": "p82_b7", "text": "- Alternative heat and drought resistant crop varieties; crop varietieswith a higher harvest index (making irrigation more effective)introduced, tested and promoted.- Risk assessment conducted, and regulations established ifgenetically modified varieties are used.- Production and marketing strategies for the best alternative crops,animals and pastures developed and implemented."}, {"text_block_id": "p81_b7", "text": "- Study on the agro-biodiversity benefits in strengthening farmresilience, yield and farmers’ income conducted, published anddisseminated.- Awareness raising campaigns on the benefits of agro-biodiversity,based on the study conducted.- Communication products and services developed and published totrain farmers on agro-biodiversity practices and raise awareness ofthe benefits of their benefits among value chain actors."}, {"text_block_id": "p80_b7", "text": "112 Implement Land Policy to enable land zoning to safeguardquality agricultural lands and identify lands best suited for theproduction of specific crops"}, {"text_block_id": "p78_b7", "text": "109 Protect wetland ecosystems, most of which are coastal and havebeen targeted as landfill sites or earmarked for development"}, {"text_block_id": "p77_b7", "text": "104 Enhance existing monitoring/alert networks on sea level risethrough effective training and outreach mechanisms"}, {"text_block_id": "p76_b7", "text": "98Improve farm drainage infrastructure, cultivation and harvestingpractices to reduce impacts of soil water stress during heavyprecipitation periods"}, {"text_block_id": "p75_b7", "text": "Promote the adoption of low flow water technologies fordomestic use (e.g. toilets and faucets)"}, {"text_block_id": "p74_b7", "text": "Strategic objective 2.

Small islands lackaccess to reliable, long-term data and in addition, there are a limited number of studies available onclimate change impacts. 38 Many small islands use less data intensive methodologies to attributecurrent and expected loss and damage to climate change. Most commonly used is simple physicalreasoning where specific impacts are related to the known effects of climate change on the drivers ofhazards. For example, the global average increase in temperature since pre-industrial times is knownto have increased sea levels and sea-surface temperatures and also resulted in variations toprecipitation patterns- all changes that result in increased intensity of hurricanes and a resultantincrease in damages. 39 Thus, impacts associated with high-intensity hurricanes may be classified asloss and
