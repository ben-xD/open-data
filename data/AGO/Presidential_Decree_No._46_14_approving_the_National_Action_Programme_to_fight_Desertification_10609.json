The Program is included in the Annex and consists of 11 sections, providing a broad introduction and background of the desertification issues, objectives and principles of the Program and its main lines of action. It is in line with the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD), which was ratified by Angola in 1997.\n\nThe program aims to be a social participatory process, including different stakeholders in the definition of objectives and actions, to deepen the knowledge of desertification processes and droughts in order to develop guidelines and strategies for their prevention and control. It presents three main lines of action: 1) Reduction of poverty and social inequality; 2) Increasing productivity of dry areas vulnerable to desertification through conservation and preservation of natural resources; 3) Institutional capacity building."}
