Section 77 on the protection of forest sets that guidelines issued by the Agency shall take into account the fact that forest land acts as sink for greenhouse gases. Part VII, section 83, 1.g) charges the Agency to measure the value of unexploited natural resources in terms of watershed protection an influences on climate and other potential genetic value. Section 89 insists on the role of rain forests as a sink for greenhouse gases."}
