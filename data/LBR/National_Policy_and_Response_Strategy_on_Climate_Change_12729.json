It notably assesses the country's vulnerabilities to climate change including regarding poverty and forest management. Identified pillars for the policy are improved governance, financing mechanisms, capacity building, technology innovation, infrastructure, integrated planning and data management. The Policy determines that adaptation and disaster risk management efforts should focus on forestry and wildlife, agriculture, coastal areas, water resources, fishery, energy, mining, industry, transport, tourism, infrastructure, urbanisation and settlement, and health.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>&nbsp;Mitigation policies include 1) the enhancement of the country's potential for carbon sequestration by promoting conservation, sustainable forest management, community forestry and curbing key drivers of deforestation and forest degradation, which in turn will contribute to sustainable wildlife management, 2) encouraging lowland farming, investing in smallholder agriculture and allowing large-scale concessions on degraded land to avoid and reduce national emissions levels, 3) marching towards universal access to affordable, sustainable, and environmentally friendly low carbon energy services, 4) ensure that the mining sector develops by gradually mixing the use of low emission energy sources and technologies, 5) a low-carbon transport system, and 6) energy recovery from waste.&nbsp; Crosscutting issues to mainstream in climate policies include communication, education and raising awareness, technology transfer, gender, HIV and AIDS.&nbsp;"}
