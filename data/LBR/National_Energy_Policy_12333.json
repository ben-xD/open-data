In the emergency phase, Liberians have been recipients of grant funds and technical and management expertise (the donors have been providing fish). In the capacity-building phase, the Government will focus on building local expertise and institutions to enable them to replicate the donor-funded managerial and technical expertise (donors will be teaching fishing). This expertise will then launch the country into the long-term development phase when the country expects to realize its vision of universal access to modern energy services for all (Liberians will be fishing for themselves)."}, {"text_block_id": "p50_b974", "text": "STATEMENTS OF POLICY"}, {"text_block_id": "p50_b975", "text": "1."}, {"text_block_id": "p50_b976", "text": "It is the policy of the Government to keep its promises by undertaking all actions required to ensure visibility and maximum participation of Liberian stakeholders in the implementation of the NEP."}, {"text_block_id": "p50_b977", "text": "2."}, {"text_block_id": "p50_b978", "text": "It is the policy of the Government to adopt an implementation timeline to serve as a reference for performance measurement in the implementation of the NEP."}, {"text_block_id": "p50_b979", "text": "EMERGENCY PHASE"}, {"text_block_id": "p50_b980", "text": "The emergency phase was launched in January 2006 and is now coming to an end with the finalization of the National Energy Policy.
