According to the Policy, this change of consumption patterns requires the use of cultural and educational capacities, promoted through public education, training programs at various levels, and an emphasis on accountable indicators.<br />\n<br />\nIt calls for the improvement of energy efficiency in power plants, industries, in the transport sector, and in residential and commercial buildings. This improvement should be promoted through the establishment of energy standards and labelling, financial incentives, among other mechanisms. The Law aims to reduce energy intensity by half in 2020."}
