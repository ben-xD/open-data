Even though the requirement for the Home Information Pack for property sales was suspended in 2010, an Energy Performance Certificate is still required.<br />\n<br />\nThere are six levels of the Code, with mandatory minimum standards for energy efficiency at each level.

Level 6 would be a completely zero-carbon home (heating, lighting, hot water and all appliances).<br />\n<br />\nImprovements in the energy efficiency of new homes of more than 25% compared to 2006 regulations (Level 3 of the code) would probably require some form of low- or zero-carbon energy generation, either by individual buildings (eg dedicated solar water heating) or by whole developments sharing a source of low carbon generation (eg wind turbines)."}
