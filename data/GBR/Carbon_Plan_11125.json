The exceptions are the impact of the EU ETS carbon price and Carbon Price Floorin the ESI, which are quantified. Such price impacts arise from: CCL fuel duties, the need to purchase CRC allowances and the cost recovery of policy measures undertaken by energy suppliers, this includes supply sidemeasures such as grid reinforcement, RO and FiTs, as well as CERT/ECO.105 For the purposes of this table, baseline is akin to the updated emissions projections baseline (pre-Low Carbon Transition Plan policies). The table shows emissions savings from only some of the policies included in thebaseline. It is not possible to quantify the emissions savings from all baseline policies individually. However, it should be noted that this does not impact on either the baseline or any of the newer policy emissions projectionsscenarios. Savings in the transport sector from the Renewable Transport Fuels Obligation and EU voluntary agreements on new car emissions have been published previously. These have not been re-estimated for thispublication.106 The original Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EPBD) introduced Energy Performance Certificates, Display Energy Certificates and other measures to improve the energy performance of buildings.

The fourth budget, for the period 2023-2027, requires emissions to be reduced by 50% compared to 1990 levels.<br />\n<br />\nThe plan includes 5 sectoral plans, covering measures to be taken during this decade and in the 2020s:<br />\n- Low carbon buildings, including energy efficiency and low carbon heating<br />\n- Low carbon transport<br />\n- Low carbon industry<br />\n- Low carbon electricity<br />\n- Agriculture, land use, forestry and waste<br />\n<br />\nThe government will support up to 1.5 million solid wall insulations and other energy efficiency measures, introduce zero-carbon home standards to support energy efficiency improvements. It will also support over 130,000 low carbon heat installations by 2020 and work with local authorities to support district heating networks. The Plan sets out that emissions from buildings should be 24%-39% lower than 2009 levels by 2027.<br />\n<br />\nThe government will support the market roll-out of ultra-low emission vehicles and the take-up of other lower carbon travel methods (walking, cycling, public transport), with the aim that transport emissions should be 17%-28% lower than 2009 levels by 2027.<br />\nEmissions from industry will be reduced by 20%-24% compared to 2009 levels by 2027, through a mix of energy efficiency measures, low carbon fuel use, EU ETS membership, and CCS development.<br />\n<br />\nBy 2027, emissions from electricity should be 75%-84% lower than 2009 levels. These reductions will come from increasing use of gas and renewables instead of coal, the introduction of Contacts for Difference in feed-in tariffs, and support for renewables development, CCS development, and reductions in the cost of offshore wind. The Plan does not set any specific technology or decarbonisation targets, and supports the lowest cost mix of nuclear, renewables and CCS use by 2027.<br />\n<br />\nThe Plan envisages significant reductions in methane emissions from landfill by 2050, as part of the move towards a zero waste economy."}
