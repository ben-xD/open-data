It also sets short term objectives, details financial resources available, discusses indicators and sets governance arrangements to be put in place in the future.The strategy is due to be updated in July 2020 through a 2 billion pounds package to pursue the following goals (among others): 1) the creation of a national cycling and walking commissioner and inspectorat, 2) higher standards for permanent infrastructure across England, 3) getting GPs to prescribe cycling and exercise, and 4) creating a long-term budget for cycling and walking similar to what happens for roads."}
