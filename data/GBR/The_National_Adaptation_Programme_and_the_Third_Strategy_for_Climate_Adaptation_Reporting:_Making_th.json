The NAP focuses on particular areas of particular importance, guided by the CCRA's assessment of the magnitude, confidence and urgency scores assigned to particular risks.  The NAP also sets out four overarching objectives to address the greatest risks and opportunities arising due to climate change: - Increasing awareness - Increasing resilience to current extremes - Taking timely action for long-lead time measures - Addressing major evidence gaps.  On July 19th, 2018, a second version of the National Adaptation Programme was released. This version covers the period 2018-2023."}
