Essentially a hybrid is a vehicle that combines electric power from an on board battery with a standard internal combustion engine (ICE) running on petrol, diesel or biofuels. A ‘‘mild hybrid’’ is one where the engine shuts down when the vehicle is stationary, and where energy from braking is used to charge up the battery, to be re-used later alongside the ICE in acceleration. These both save energy and reduce carbon emissions. A ‘‘full hybrid’’ refers to a vehicle which can run purely on stored electric energy for limited distances, without burning any fuel. The car will run on electric power at low speeds where the efficiency of the ICE is low, and on normal engine power at higher speeds where efficiency is high, thereby maximising the overall efficiency of the car."}, {"text_block_id": "p36_b444", "text": "For existing hybrids the range of the electric-only mode is limited, while all the energy ultimately comes from the petrol or diesel in the car. If a larger battery is used and is charged from an external source then a vehicle could be used in electric mode for longer distances. This is called a ‘‘plug-in hybrid’’ and could be used for short-medium length journeys purely in electric mode, with longer trips using the ICE and petrol or diesel fuel. Last is a purely-electric vehicle which has a battery large enough to make all its trips in electric only mode and does not use an ICE or liquid fuel. Existing electric only vehicles have limited range due to the constraints of battery technology.

When biofuels are burned, they release into the atmosphere the carbon that they absorbed in the growing process. In this way biofuels can be ‘‘carbon neutral’’ in that they absorb and release the same carbon.

Many Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) technologies are likely to deliver their main benefits in reducing congestion and improving traffic flows – which can potentially deliver additional benefits in terms of reduced emissions and improved fuel consumption. The DfT has published an ITS strategy for the roads sector.Nor are ITS systems only applicable to road applications -advanced train safety systems, better air traffic systems and electronic navigation for shipping can all contribute to more efficient useage of transport networks. ITS systems can also be used to provide information that helps people make better travel choices -and therefore makes better use of transport and capacity. The DfT’s Transport Direct internet system -a world first -enables travellers to plan door-to-door journeys anywhere within Britain, using any mode of transport.
