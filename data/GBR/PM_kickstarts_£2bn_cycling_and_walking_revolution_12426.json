Four themes are laid out in the document: 1) better streets for cycling and people, 2) cycling and walking at the heart of decision-making, 3) empowering and encouraging local authorities, 4) enabling people to cycle and protecting them when they do. Physical and mental health is explicitly mentioned as an argument for increasing walking and cycling rates.Under this plan, the government will build more (protected) cycle lanes, provide cycle training for everyone and bikes available on prescription. It will also create a long term cycling programme, consult to strengthen the Highway Code for safety purposes, support local authorities to crack down on traffic offenses, create low traffic neighbourhoods to improve air quality, focus on areas with poor average health and increase access to e-bikes. A budget of two billion pounds has been allocated to this plan. Bike repair vouchers worth £50 will be released under a pilot plan. A scheme to support bike repairers is also considered."}
