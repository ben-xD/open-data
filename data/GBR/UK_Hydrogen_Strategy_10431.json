create an integrated low carbon hydrogen sector in the UK. It considers changes to the regulatory framework, aims to assess jobs opportunity, and makes a range of financial commitments and targets, notably: 1) 5GW of low carbon hydrogen production capacity by 2030 (1GW by 2025), 2) provision of £240m for the Net Zero Hydrogen Fund out to 2024/25, 3) deliver hydrogen for heat trials, and 4) provide up to £120 million this year through the Zero Emission Bus Regional Areas (ZEBRA) scheme towards 4,000 new zero emission buses, either hydrogen or battery electric, and infrastructure needed to support them. The strategy also calls for the development of metrics to monitor progress against outcomes and the commitments made, including incorporating data on hydrogen production into the Digest of UK Energy Statistics."}
