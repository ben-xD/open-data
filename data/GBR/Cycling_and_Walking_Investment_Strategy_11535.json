The consultation invited respondents to provide answers on five questions around our proposed activities, and these comments have been taken into account in the development of the final Strategy.\n* This Strategy has been set out in three chapters, the first detailing our ambition for walking and cycling and the objectives to move us closer to this ambition. Chapter 2 sets out the financial resources available to support these objectives, as well as governance and performance monitoring arrangements. The final chapter describes the specific actions planned to support delivery of the ambition and objectives during the first phase of the Cycling and Walking Investment Strategy.\n* In addition to publishing the Strategy we have also published the following accompanying documents:\n\t* Government response to the consultation on the draft Strategy\n\t* Cycling and Walking Investment Strategy: Investment Inputs, Outputs and Outcomes\n\t* Cycling and Walking Investment Strategy: Information leaflet for members of the public"}, {"text_block_id": "p6_b72", "text": "The Government's ambition for cycling and walking in England"}, {"text_block_id": "p6_b73", "text": "The Government's ambition for cycling and walking in England\n* The Government wants walking and cycling to be a normal part of everyday life, and the natural choices for shorter journeys such as going to school, college or work, travelling to the station, and for simple enjoyment.

A Clean Air Zone defines an area where targeted action is taken to improve air quality and where resources are prioritised and co-ordinated in order to deliver improved health benefits and support economic growth in the urban environment. They aim to address sources of pollution, including nitrogen dioxide and particulate matter, and reduce public exposure to them using a range of measures tailored to the particular location, including encouraging active travel improving people’s health while removing polluting journeys."}, {"text_block_id": "p37_b531", "text": "3.37"}, {"text_block_id": "p37_b532", "text": "Following the High Court judgement on air quality the Government is considering next steps in light of both the judgement and recent updates in data on emissions from diesel vehicles and we will publish an updated plan shortly."}, {"text_block_id": "p37_b533", "text": "3.38"}, {"text_block_id": "p37_b534", "text": "Birmingham, Derby, Leeds, Nottingham, and Southampton are required to introduce a Clean Air Zone, and the Government has allocated funding to help implement these Zones.

It also sets short term objectives, details financial resources available, discusses indicators and sets governance arrangements to be put in place in the future.The strategy is due to be updated in July 2020 through a 2 billion pounds package to pursue the following goals (among others): 1) the creation of a national cycling and walking commissioner and inspectorat, 2) higher standards for permanent infrastructure across England, 3) getting GPs to prescribe cycling and exercise, and 4) creating a long-term budget for cycling and walking similar to what happens for roads."}
