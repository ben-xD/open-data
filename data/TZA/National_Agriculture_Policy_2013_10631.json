At the same time, the Government continued to support large scale farming in selected areas. Following the Arusha Declaration, the Government became the manager entrepreneur and investor. These policies had unexpected results of causing stagnation of the agricultural sector causing substantial reduction in productivity and incomes.

On the other hand, the productivity potential for paddy is as high as 6-8 tons per hectare while the average actual productivity is only 2.0-3.8 tons per hectare. The productivity of cotton is as little as 0.4 tons per hectare while there the potential is about 2 tons per hectare. The ASR of 2008/2009 revealed that, over the last 12 years, the comparison of demand and supply of fertilizers shows there was a gap of about 33 per cent. In Tanzania, only 10kg of fertilizer is used per hectare as compared to as high as 50kg per hectare in South Africa, while the SADC average is 16kg/hectare and Vietnam is 365kg/hectare. The same study revealed that the estimated annual requirement for improved seeds of cereals, legumes and oil seeds in the country is 120,000 tons.
