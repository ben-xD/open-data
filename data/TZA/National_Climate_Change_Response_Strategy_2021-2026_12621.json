Mitigation is addressed through low-emission energy technologies, policies to conserve energy usage by industries, improved livestock management and food stuffs, greater efficiency in the transportation, mining, agriculture and waste management industries, and afforestation and reforestation policies (including REDD+). Additionally, cross-cutting programmes seek to implement public awareness programmes, establish research capacity and training institutions for climate change. The Strategy's estimated financial requirements are USD750m per year through to 2030, with the funding to come from international and some domestic support.The National Strategy for Mainstreaming Gender in Climate Change in Tanzania has also been produced as part of this strategy."}
