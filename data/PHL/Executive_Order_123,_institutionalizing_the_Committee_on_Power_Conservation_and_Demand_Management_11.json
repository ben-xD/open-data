The CPCDM is headed by a private individual and Co-Chaired by a DOE undersecretary, with nine other government agencies and six private organisations and NGOs making up the CPCDM Committee. The major role of CPCDM is to promote power conservation and demand management through an information, education and communication campaign (IEC) in the commercial, industrial, residential and academic sectors. To raise public awareness, a multitude of seminar-workshops were held in major cities and municipalities throughout the country. Provincial, city or municipal chapters were formed and headed by the President of the Philippine Chamber of Commerce and Industry (PCCI) from said region, city or municipality. These chapters are mirror image of the national CPCDM Committee and were designed to provide sustainability of the whole program concept that is to propagate values formation among energy users.<br />\n<br />\nA Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) is part of the activity during the formal establishment of a chapter in a locality. Participation in the seminar-workshop varies depending on the target sectors. For the academe, students from grade 5 and 6 elementary and 3rd and 4th year high school were invited to attend, while plant facility personnel, employees and managers of companies from commercial and industrial sectors likewise attended. Similarly, household owners and members of home associations and the Barangay Chairman and Council members were the target participants to represent the Barangay residential sector."}
