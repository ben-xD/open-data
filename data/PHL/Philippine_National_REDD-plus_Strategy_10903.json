degradation and the role of conservation of carbons stocks, sustainable management of forests and enhancement of forest carbon stocks in developing countries, supported by financing from industrialized nations.  As the global initiative on REDD-plus has come to the forefront of international climate change mitigation policy, opportunities for pilot projects have emerged across Southeast Asia, including in the Philippines.  The Philippines offers an enabling environment for REDD-plus development: a strong research community and national capacity to engage with forestry projects, relatively decentralized natural resource management capable of instituting local-level REDD-plus projects, enabling environmental, social and rights-based policies and frameworks, a robust civil society capable of supporting REDD-plus development and implementation at multiple scales, and significant opportunities to generate social and environmental co-benefits."}, {"text_block_id": "p3_b46", "text": "In early 2009, several NGOs noted the potential of REDD-plus in the Philippines and the need for domestic climate change mitigation actions. As Government had not yet commenced REDD-plus planning, civil society spearheaded related consultations, mapping and capacity building throughout the country. Through these efforts, the CoDe REDD was formed to ensure that national REDD-plus developments yield co-benefits for biodiversity conservation and community development.  After a series of workshops and increased interest from Government and the Department of Environment and Natural Resources-Forest Management Bureau (DENR-FMB), CoDe REDD partners identified the need to develop a multistakeholder REDD-plus strategy in order to facilitate REDD-plus development in the Philippines; guide REDD-plus discussions within the development of the National Framework Strategy and Program on Climate Change; inform international donors and investors of country intentions; provide an initial national resource for domestic institutions interested in REDD-plus and for continued, broadened stakeholder engagement, and guide a future, targeted action plan.

The PNRPS proposes strategies to increase stakeholder engagement and coordination in the forestry sector.  This will require strengthening existing and creating new institutional arrangements capable of bringing together diverse stakeholders and capable of integrating REDD-plus strategies into existing development and management plans.  As such, the Strategy proposes a National Multistakeholder REDD-plus Council led by the Department of Environment and Natural Resources and complementary decision-making and accounting bodies at the regional, provincial and local levels, designs for which are discussed.  At the local level, the PNRPS proposes to build on existing sub-national forest management structures and regimes to ensure that local Forest Management Units (FMUs) are recognized, capable of local REDD-plus implementation, and capacitated to gather data for local accounting of carbon and non-carbon impacts and benefits.  These structures will further facilitate local engagement, share information, resolve conflicts, and report on safeguards related to the forestry sector.  Developing and strengthening new structures, improving existing arrangements and integrating plans, however, will require significant stakeholder education, consultation and engagement, technical support and strengthened linkages among the agencies that will be responsible for REDD-plus implementation.  The PNRPS further addresses the need for equitable benefit sharing as a strategy to incentivize improved implementation and governance in the forestry sector.

Robust research agendas should accompany these trials to yield information on topics including the effectiveness of different conservation interventions; appropriate techniques for carbon accounting, measuring, reporting and verification (MRV); review of non-carbon social and environmental impacts and benefits, and the selection of appropriate and equitable benefit sharing arrangements.

The PNRPS proposes a staged adoption of both strategies.  During the Readiness Phase, the PNRPS proposes to maximize limited domestic resources to catalyze initial readiness, while seeking immediate voluntary donor funding in the form of grants.  As pilot/demonstration project mature, the PNRPS proposes their engagement with voluntary carbon markets.

These include exploring potential for a national REDD-plus reserve fund, use of conservative buffers, and opportunities to generate self-sustaining low-emissions rural livelihoods.
