performance by adopting measures that promote resource management effiency and site sustainability while minimizing the negative impact of buildings on human health and the environment. The Code proposes a set of standards which apply to efficient use of resources, site selection, planning, design, construction, use, occupancy, operation and maintenance.&nbsp;</div><div><br>The Green Building Code shares the following principles: 1) the technical professionals, developers, contractors, property managers and building owners involved in the planning, design, construction and management of buildings have the opportunity to help government address the adverse effects of climate change by ensuring that buildings are planned, designed, constructed, operated and maintained to the required efficiency level; 2) resources must be used efficiently to equitably meet the developmental and environmental needs of the present and future generations; 3) occupants of green buildings will benefit from improved indoor environmental quality which promotes higher productivity and better comfort."}
