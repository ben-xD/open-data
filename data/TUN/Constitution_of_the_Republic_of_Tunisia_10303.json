Establishing a new Constitution resulted from political tensions between the Islamist party and opposition forces. This Constitution was adopted by the Constituent Assembly in January 2014 with 200 votes for, 12 against and four abstentions. It provides for an environmental provision that simultaneously guaranteed the right to a healthy and balanced environment and the right to participate in the protection of the climate. Noteworthy, the wording does not imply any obligation or commitment from the State on the matter, other than eradicating pollution. It reads as follows: “The state guarantees the right to a healthy and balanced environment and the right to participate in the protection of the climate. The state shall provide the necessary means to eradicate pollution of the environment”.&nbsp;"}
