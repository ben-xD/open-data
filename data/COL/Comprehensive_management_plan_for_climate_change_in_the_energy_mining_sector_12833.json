The <a href=\"https://www.minminas.gov.co/documents/10180//23517//15333066739365700PresentaciÃ³n+PIGCCME.pdf\">Plan</a> aims at reducing vulnerability to climate change and promoting low carbon development at sector level, strengthening and protecting the sustainability and competitiveness of the industry.\n\nThe Plan seeks in particular at reducing GHG emissions in the sector, and sets specific targets in that direction, including regarding flaring emissions. It also analyses how to incorporate adaptation and disaster risk management within the mining decision-making structure. Improving governance is a key aspect of the plan, notably through monitoring, reporting, coordination, financing cooperation and knowledge management. The document also calls for low-carbon cooperation across with the transport sector, and for a compensation system to remunerate actors engaging in mitigation activities."}
