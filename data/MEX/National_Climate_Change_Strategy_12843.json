These are:<br />\n1) Reduce vulnerability to climate change of Mexicans living at risk and strengthen their resilience;<br />\n2) Reduce the vulnerability of production systems and strategic infrastructure against weather contingencies;<br />\n3) Foster adaptability of ecosystems to the effects of global warming;<br />\n4) Accelerate energy transition towards clean energy sources;<br />\n5) Reduce power consumption intensity through efficiency and rationality schemes;<br />\n6) Transition to sustainable city models, with intelligent mobility systems, integrated waste management and buildings with a low carbon footprint;<br />\n7) Encourage better agricultural and forestry practices, with schemes for Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD+);<br />\n8) Reduce short lived pollutant emissions, such as black carbon and methane, to improve the health and welfare of Mexicans.<br />\nThe Strategy also reinforces Mexico's mitigation goals to reduce emissions by 30% by the year 2020 with respect to the business-as-usual scenario, and by 50% by 2050, as compared with emissions in 2000."}
