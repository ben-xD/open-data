The private sector can be called upon to manage, operate, invest and/or own energy entities and operations.  Each different mechanism has its advantages and disadvantages.  Often, there is a progression from management through ownership that takes into account the current situation. In the electricity sub-sector for example, it is highly unlikely under the current security, institutional, policy and legal/regulatory situation that private investors will be attracted to invest in a large-scale power plant.  However, until these issues are resolved, there are many other ways to use the private sector. Billing can be outsourced. The construction arms of DABM could be sold off, allowing DABM to focus on core operations.  Following DABM’s commercialization, distribution could be given on a management contract. Individual power plants could be given on management contract.

For example, the distribution part of DABM might be separated into several smaller distribution companies and then sold as could be generation.  The empirical evidence is mixed and does not strongly support one position or the other. In fact, many of the earlier proponents of unbundling have now taken a more conservative position that the virtues of unbundling depend upon numerous factors such as the size of the market, the availability of substitutes, the cost production and the overall structure and position of the sector within the economy. Simply put, when a country or market are small, unbundling may not achieve the results it will in larger, more mature markets. Afghanistan’s market is quite small and immature.

Functional unbundling also means accounting unbundling.
