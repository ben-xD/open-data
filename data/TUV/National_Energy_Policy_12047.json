It outlines a goal for Tuvalu of 100% renewable energy by 2020, namely solar, wind and biofuels, and estimates a total cost of achieving this of $20 million. To achieve this goal it suggests, among other strategies, reviving a national solar energy company that ceased operations due to management issues and calls for energy efficiency measures in all sectors. The policy also aims to reduce dependence on petroleum products by encouraging fuel conservation and actively searching for alternatives."}
