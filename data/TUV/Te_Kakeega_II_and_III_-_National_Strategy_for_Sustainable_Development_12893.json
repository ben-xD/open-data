Staff from the Department of Planning and Budget, representatives from TANGO and from EKT met with the eight island communities on Funafuti, and their seven counterparts in the outer islands. Discussions focused on the performance of TKII, plans for TKIII, and what should be emphasized in TKIII. In all more than 300 people were consulted, including more than 100 island leaders who were invited to the TKIII National Summit. Summit delegates, who represented a broad spectrum of Tuvalu society, adopted the Malefatuga II Declaration, which presents the Summit’s outcome.

It continues work on unfinished business, takes on new initiatives and development objectives, and adds four new strategic areas, in addition to the eight identified in TKII.

Climate change presents grave challenges, which are in need of urgent attention and that cut across the scope of TKIII. Focus on the environment, previously captured under the broad natural resource umbrella, is now separately emphasized. This highlights the major importance the government assigns to protecting the environment, and by extension the importance the rest of the world places on environmental protection. Migration and urbanization are phenomena that reside at the forefront of numerous challenges facing the domestic economy and society at large. These challenges demand more attention that they have received in the recent past. The protection and management Tuvalu’s ocean areas is, of course, of special interest.

Detailed under the strategic area of Natural Resources, mitigating climate change-related agricultural impacts and minimising climate change impacts on the environment in general are highlighted as key policy objectives. Specific priorities and strategies are to establish national climate change adaptation and mitigation policies, and to encourage international adoption of Multilateral Environmental Agreements, including the Kyoto Protocol."}
