It establishes a Forestry Unit under the authority of the Ministry of the Environment and Housing to regulate activities such as wood exploitation, to declare and manage forest reserves, and monitor protected trees. Reserves should be declared according to environmental conservation objectives, in particular to protect wildlife and prevent fires. The Act also regulates activities held on privately-held lands. Every five year, a Forest Management Plans must be developed.<br />\n<br />\nIn 2014, Forestry Regulations updated and precise the applicability of the original Act, notably in order to include carbon sequestration and reforestation within the possible objectives of Forest Management Plans. Private land-owners are equally encouraged to prepare such plans. Forest roads cannot be used as public highways unless a special governmental authorisation is priorly issued. The Regulations require that 20% of the land cover shall be designated into either a forest reserve, a protected forest or a conservation forest."}
