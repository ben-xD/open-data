In line with the Hyogo Framework for Action (HFA), the Maldives government adopted future outlook statements that are summarized in its 2008 HFA Monitor.\n\nIn more concrete terms, the SNAP process will provide a means for the Maldives to identify a consolidated set of programs/projects that can be undertaken with the Government budget and those that may be considered for donor assistance and the Country Programme Action Plan (CPAP)/ Country Cooperation Strategy (CCS). It is harmonized with the policies and plans of the government as well as its decentralization strategy.\n\nThe SANP presents a general context fo the country and climate change, to then present a Strategic National Agenda on Disaster Risk Reduction and Climate Change Adaptation, and finally challenges for implementation."}
