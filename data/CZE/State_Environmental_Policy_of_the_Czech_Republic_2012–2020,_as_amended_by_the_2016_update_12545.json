Objectives include climate mitigation, adaptation and the sustainable management of natural resources to contribute towards an improvement of the quality of life for Czech citizens and its neighbours.  The policy has a climate protection component in conjunction with improving air quality. It aims to reduce per capita GHG emissions to 10.5 tCO2eq by 2020 (17% lower than 2009 levels). It also aims to reduce GHG emissions within the EU ETS by 21% and to limit the GHG emission growth for sectors not covered by the EU ETS to 9% by 2020 (from 2005 levels).  Key measures include the promotion of renewable energies and especially energy efficiency via more energy efficient technologies. Further objectives include improving adaptation to climate change, and improving the ambient air quality, particularly in locations where emission limits are exceeded."}
