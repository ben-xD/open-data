It focuses on measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and therefore it is a complementary to the 2015 Strategy on Adaptation to Climate Change. The implementation of the CPP will be evaluated by the end of 2021 and updated by the end of 2023. The document 1) addresses the national trends in GHG emissions, 2) sets the objectives and priorities of the country to reduce the emissions, 3) project scenarios up to 2030 and 2050, 4) establishes sectoral mitigation policies and measures, 5) discusses costs and financing of the proposed policies, and 6) addresses the necessary evaluation and reporting procedures. This policy was adopted by Government resolution No. 207 of 22nd March 2017. It updates the 2004 National Programme to Abate the Climate Change Impacts."}
