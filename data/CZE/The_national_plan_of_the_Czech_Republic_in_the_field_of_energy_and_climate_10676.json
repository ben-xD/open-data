Quantified objectives are provided for in the plan. There are three energy efficiency-related targets for the period 2021–2030: 1) an indicative target for the size of primary energy sources, final consumption and energy intensity; 2) a binding energy savings target for public sector building, 3) a binding year-on-year rate of final consumption savings."}
