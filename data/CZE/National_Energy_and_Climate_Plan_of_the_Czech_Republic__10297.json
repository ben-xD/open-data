Growth of sources with high-efficiency cogeneration can also be expected in the area of biomass utilisation, biogas stations(including heat transfer from existing sources) and the development of energy recovery of waste.However, the development of these high-efficiency CHP areas is conditional on maintainingstable economic incentives for investors and resource providers. In relation to large sources, only limited potential for the development of high-efficiency CHPwas identified. Heat from large sources such as CHP plants, company power plants and mostpower plants is currently being used at the place of production, or transferred to the consumerthrough a heat supply system (HSS). In HSS with large sources, it will rather involve a changein the fuel base (co-firing of renewable energy sources (RES)) or alternative fuels, orimprovement (increase) of CHP parameters (achieving higher efficiency or primary energysavings) as a result of resource reconstruction. However, concerning large sources, the risk of apossible reduction of electricity production from high-efficiency CHP cannot be overlooked.Current developments in the energy markets (and their consequences in the form of a reductionin wholesale electricity prices) can cause a downturn in electricity generation from high-efficiency CHP at large sources and a switch to a partially heat-plant operating regime.

At the time of the preparation of the National Plan,neither the revised EUROSTAT methodology nor the calculation file was available to be able to verify how the changes in the Directive would be reflected in the calculation;this is also very problematic with regard to the comparability of individual values between Member States. The Czech Republic therefore made all the changes so that thecalculation complies as closely as possible with the requirements of Directive (EU) 2018/2001.17 The RES consumption for the calculation of the sectoral targets, which is shown below in the tables, and the RES consumption in the sector for the calculation of the overalltarget differ in accordance with the methodology.18 The methodology for determining RES share in gross final consumption is not entirely trivial. Other values are used to determine the sectoral shares and the total share insome cases; for example, values including and excluding multipliers were used for transport. There are also partial modifications to avoid double counting, for example withregard to the consumption of electricity in the transport sector. The overall denominator, i.e. ‘gross final consumption’, does not correspond to ‘final consumption’ withinthe energy balance, and there are some differences."}, {"text_block_id": "p219_b17", "text": "Source: 7.

Quantified objectives are provided for in the plan. There are three energy efficiency-related targets for the period 2021–2030: 1) an indicative target for the size of primary energy sources, final consumption and energy intensity; 2) a binding energy savings target for public sector building, 3) a binding year-on-year rate of final consumption savings."}
