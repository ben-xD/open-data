The law authorises the State to subsidy, from 2013 to 2020, the municipalities committed via the signature of a Climate Pact to apply a mitigation programme. Such a programme must comprise a quality assessment ending up in a «European Energy Award®» certificate and quantified measures.  Several types of subsidies are elaborated to encourage municipalities to adopt and seriously commit to the Pact. These subsidies are modified in the 2016 amendment."}
