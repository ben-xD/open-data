This study assessed the potential of the heating network supply and revealed that a significant proportion of the co-generation potential is already being exploited in the building sector. However, there is still potential to further develop the current situation in the future. Mainly as a result of the high energy standard for buildings (NZEB for residential buildings since 2017), the Luxembourg government expects a high number of potential heating and cooling uses for low-temperature heating networks. These low-temperature networks will in future be supplied predominantly from environmentally friendly sources (deep geothermal energy, heat pumps, waste heat from industry and data centres, solar thermal installations), insofar as this is economically viable. High potential, particularly in the field of geothermal energy, is expected in the south of the country. The opportunities for using medium-depth geothermal energy for heating networks to supply residential areas, schools and sports complexes are currently being studied more closely. In this context, myenergy, in cooperation with the Luxembourg Geological Service and a research institute, is launching a project to improve the data currently available, to more accurately assess the geothermal potential in Luxembourg and to provide scientific support for construction projects currently planned."}, {"text_block_id": "p91_b1122", "text": "Heat map"}, {"text_block_id": "p91_b1123", "text": "The creation of a web-based heat map will increase transparency on the heat market by means of an integrated analysis and presentation of the relevant data in this connection.

However, the tool will also be used by the municipalities as part of the Climate Pact, for example to implement energy planning or general accounting within the Climate Pact. However, existing heating networks will also be represented and an assessment of potential energy recovery (i.e. sewage sludge drying) will also be carried out. There are also plans to map the energy sources used to produce heat and the share of heat they produce. Additionally, a hot-spot analysis will make it possible to identify larger renovation areas and possible synergies at industrial level. The economic viability of potential projects for planners and companies will be better assessed using relevant indicators.

In principle, network expansion needs arising from an increase in demand can be dampened by a simultaneous increase in distributed production capacity, but only if load and production are in close proximity and correlated over time or integrated via decentralised storage solutions. It should also be noted that the network expansion requirement for PV installations is generally higher than for wind turbines, as the latter are usually connected directly to higher network levels. This also provides a plausibility check for the higher network expansion requirement in the target scenario, in which considerably more PV installations are expected."}, {"text_block_id": "p189_b2305", "text": "5.4."}, {"text_block_id": "p189_b2306", "text": "Impacts of the planned policies and measures described in Section 3 on other Member States and regional cooperation"}, {"text_block_id": "p189_b2307", "text": "In a small open country like Luxembourg, climate and energy policy objectives also have a cross-border dimension.
