The law seeks to increase the share of renewable resources in the national electricity production as well as energy efficiency on the consumer side.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;The law normalises and simplifies procedures to facilitate the connection to the grid of decentralised energy producers using cogeneration, and to provide the necessary information for the connection of any new energy producer using renewables or cogeneration. The grid manager must also guarantee the transport and distribution of renewably sourced energy and a grid access, provided that the grid reliability is maintained.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;The law also states that the public service's duty with regard to electricity supply includes environmental protection, and thus energy efficiency, renewably sourced energy and climate protection, while ensuring to all European Union suppliers equal access to national consumers."}
