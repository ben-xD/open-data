The NBSAP set out a framework with strategic objectives and elaborated a series of prioritised projects, conceptualised and developed through stakeholder consultation, identifying implementing agencies, budgets and timelines. The review found implementation of the NBSAP's strategic objectives was good and broad. Implementation of specific projects was \"fair'' and underestimated actual national implementation as the NBSAP was not periodically updated, meaning that emerging issues and priorities which were addressed are not reflected in the project components of the NBSAP. Of particular note was the broad societal implementation of projects: of the successful projects 37.5% were implemented by NGOs, 37.5% by Government and 25% as direct Government/NGO partnership.
