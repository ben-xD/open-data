Tourism now accounts for about 29 per cent of foreign exchange earnings, 20 per cent of GDP and one third of employment. Climate change will impact tourism through its effects on the resources (e.g. beaches & coral reefs) and infrastructure (e.g. hotels & guesthouses) that are critical to tourism services and on the climate-related amenities that tourists seek when visiting destinations such as the Seychelles (Payet, 2007). The effects of climate change on tourism in small islands are expected to be largely negative (Mimura et al, 2007). Sea-level rise, rising sea surface temperatures, increased tropical cyclone intensity and changes in ocean chemistry from higher carbon dioxide concentrations are likely to negatively impact the health of coral reef systems, another major tourist attraction of the Seychelles and also important to the islands’ fisheries and conservation of biodiversity.

Although fire contingency plans and other measures are in place, such as fire breaks, the lack of suitable early warning and fire control equipment hampers both prevention and response. It is expected that extended droughts may increase the likelihood of forest fires (Payet, 2005).
