Furthermore, the need for active involvement of the stakeholders of the coastal resources on site specific basis was further advocated by various quarters due to inadequate outcomes of the other national CZM policies. Thus Special Management area Planning was conceived as a “bottom-up” approach for managing coastal resources that complements the “top-down” regulatory approach practiced by CC&CrMd since its inception. The concept of Special Management areas (SMa’s) evolved based on the co-management principles and involves a collaborative, adaptive and flexible approach to resource management within a defined geographic area, was formally introduced as an auxiliary CZM policy through the National Coastal Zone Management Plan of 1997.  Prior to formal adoption, the concept was tested on the ground in two pilot sites vis. hikkaduwa and rekawa under the Coastal resources Management Project funded by USaid in 1992. The pilot initiative contributed to demonstrate the potential of adopting SMa process as an effective tool to manage coastal resources in a collaborative manner.  Based on the experience gained from the pilot testing of SMa, the report “Coastal 2000; Resources Management Strategy for Sri Lankas Coastal Region” also recommended the design and implementation of Special Management area Plans for the specific coastal sites with special ecological and economic significance. Although SMA planning has been tested and formally adopted by the 1997 National CZMP, there were no legal provisions to formulate and implement the SMa Plans in a formal manner until the new legal provisions were introduced through the Coast Conservation (amendment) act No.49 of 2011. Thus, at the initial phase of the process, administrative arrangements had been made to formulate and implement SMa Plans with the involvement of stakeholders constituting the community, local support institutions such as Pradesiya Sabas, divisional Secretariats, outside local beneficiaries, central government institutions such as DWLC, Forest Department, and the external stakeholders"}, {"text_block_id": "p79_b1784", "text": "5.1.2 Evolution and Operational Experience"}, {"text_block_id": "p79_b1785", "text": "The experience gained from the implementation of first generation CZMP prepared in 1990, calls for a"}, {"text_block_id": "p79_b1786", "text": "greater emphasis on local level stakeholder participation in managing coastal resources.

Thus it is made mandatory under the act for any person, whether in the private or the state sector or, intending to engage in a development activity within the “Coastal Zone” (except for the prescribed activities for which permits are not required) to obtain a permit issued by the director General. activities that may be engaged in without a permit have been prescribed by Coast Conservation regulation No.1 of 1983 and published in Gazette No. 260/22 of 2nd September1983."}, {"text_block_id": "p97_b2305", "text": "6.2.1 Development activities within the “Coastal Zone” for which the permit is required"}, {"text_block_id": "p97_b2306", "text": "development activities within the “Coastal Zone” for which the permit is required from director General of CC&CrMd are as follows;"}, {"text_block_id": "p98_b2307", "text": "6.2.2 Prescribed Activities that may be engaged in without a permit issued by the Director General – CC&CRM within the “Coastal Zone”"}, {"text_block_id": "p98_b2308", "text": "6.2.3 Categorization of Permits"}, {"text_block_id": "p98_b2309", "text": "Three categories of permits have been introduced through CZMP’s of 1990, 1997, and 2004 respectively. accordingly major permit, minor permit and emergency permit have been issued. as per the 2018 CZ&CrMP guidelines, all development permits will be issued by the director General of CC&CrM under two categories viz. “Type a” permit and “Type B” permit."}, {"text_block_id": "p99_b2310", "text": "The permits issued under emergency situation are as follows;"}, {"text_block_id": "p99_b2311", "text": ""}, {"text_block_id": "p99_b2312", "text": "flood control measures or any other natural hazard control measures."}, {"text_block_id": "p99_b2313", "text": ""}, {"text_block_id": "p99_b2314", "text": "Removal of sand bars to prevent floods."}, {"text_block_id": "p99_b2315", "text": ""}, {"text_block_id": "p99_b2316", "text": "Construction of salt water intrusion prevention structures on a temporary basis."}, {"text_block_id": "p99_b2317", "text": ""}, {"text_block_id": "p99_b2318", "text": "intervention at a time when threat / destruction is caused to life of people, or public/private property, until such time a “Type a”/”Type B”  permit is obtained."}, {"text_block_id": "p99_b2319", "text": ""}, {"text_block_id": "p99_b2320", "text": "National security purposes"}, {"text_block_id": "p99_b2321", "text": "The duration of the permits issued under emergency situation is determined by the director General of the Coast Conservation and Coastal resources Management department"}, {"text_block_id": "p99_b2322", "text": "The criteria that will be adopted in reviewing “Type a” and “Type B” Permits are as follows;"}, {"text_block_id": "p100_b2323", "text": "6.2.5 Guidelines for issuing Permits for Removal of Sand"}, {"text_block_id": "p100_b2324", "text": "The following guidelines shall apply to permits issued for sand removal for non- commercial use. it should"}, {"text_block_id": "p100_b2325", "text": "however be noted that, in considering the dynamic nature of the coastal zone, site specific guidelines"}, {"text_block_id": "p100_b2326", "text": "will be issued from time to time during the plan implementation period."}, {"text_block_id": "p100_b2327", "text": "•"}, {"text_block_id": "p100_b2328", "text": "Removal of sand shall be permitted confined to the locations that are specified by the Coast Conservation and Coastal Resources Management Department.
