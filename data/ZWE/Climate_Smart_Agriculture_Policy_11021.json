Achieving sustainable food production calls for a paradigm shift that allows institutional arrangements and the creation of synergies focused on championing the components of Climate-smart Agriculture (CSA). While the Ministry of Agriculture, Mechanisation and Irrigation Development (MoAMID) and the Ministry of Environment, Water and Climate are the major players in the promotion of climate action, there is often a disconnect between these sister institutions, coupled with conflict between farmers and policymakers. A coordinated, legally binding institutional framework for the enforcement of CSA interventions is required given the need for greater coordination and integration among institutions. The instrument is designed to remove bottlenecks while ensuring concerted effort that maximises established synergies while minimising trade-offs between institutions and actors. The CSA policy should therefore be premised on a framework that is clear, scalable and inclusive, taking advantage of the entry points that already exist in the CSA technologies and practices undertaken by a number of state and non-state actors. These include the Department of Research and Specialists Services, the Agricultural Research Council, International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT), Scientific and Industrial Research and Development Centre (SIRDC), Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR), Non-governmental Organisations (NGOs) and other similar research institutions.

In the face of such challenges, Zimbabwe needs to adapt a rigorous landscape approach that will have a positive impact across sectors. This approach places human welfare at the centre of the land-use decision-making process. Normally, the landscape approach is categorised into three components for operationalisation, viz.: landscape goals embracing multiple objectives at different scales, adaptive planning, management, and collaboration, and comprehensive sector involvement. In this chapter, 10 key principles, which can be taken as a checklist for the implementation and operationalisation of landscape management, are discussed. Furthermore, good governance is imperative in landscape approaches, since this determines the levels of transparency through which resources are shared. Among the issues that are critical in the landscape approach are capacity-building, land tenure security, integrated land-use planning and stakeholder participation. Barriers to the landscape approach include policy and institutional hurdles, socio-economic factors, lack of knowledge, and uncoordinated funding for mitigation and adaptation.

Agriculture contributes to climate change mainly through releases of methane from rice cultivation and enteric fermentation and of nitrous oxide from fertiliser application. Additionally, agriculture exacerbates climate change through carbon dioxide (CO2) releases associated with deforestation and burning. To reduce the contribution of agriculture to climate change, farmers have to shift to practices such as more appropriate application of fertilisers, less soil disturbance and better irrigation techniques, etc. Additionally, researchers have advised farmers to promote carbon sequestration, i.e., the natural and deliberate processes by which CO2 is removed from the atmosphere or diverted from emission sources and stored in the ocean, terrestrial environments (vegetation, soils and sediments) and geological formations."}, {"text_block_id": "p90_b1447", "text": "It is against this background that this chapter will attempt to identify agricultural soil and water management practices suitable for Zimbabwe."}, {"text_block_id": "p90_b1448", "text": "6.1.2  What is new in climate-smart agriculture?"}, {"text_block_id": "p90_b1449", "text": "CSAis a relatively new approach in Zimbabwe.

Since droughts are frequent in Regions IV and V, farmers are not keen to use expensive chemical fertiliser, even though the soils are inherently poor.

The probability of drought-induced crop-livestock system failures ranges from 40% to 100% in most agro-ecological regions of Zimbabwe (Figure 8.1). Much reduction in net primary production and carrying capacity is expected in the southern region of Zimbabwe which is suited to extensive cattle ranching. The level of vulnerability among livestock smallholders is also increased by soil salinity, outbreaks of foot and mouth diseases, knowledge gaps, and poor access to resources and markets. On the other hand, livestock, especially ruminants (sheep, goats and cattle), contribute to climate change through (i) enteric fermentation that produces the greenhouse gases methane and carbon dioxide; (ii) poor manure management producing the greenhouse gas (GHG) nitrous oxide; and (iii) changes in land-use patterns along the livestock feed supply chain.

These legumes are highly tolerant to moisture stress and can be very productive even in the harsh climate typical of Natural Region V. Farmers with reliable water sources were also encouraged to plant other types of fodder such as Lucerne, Bana grass and Katambora Rhodes grass as these usually require supplementary irrigation. A number of farmers are now tasked with the responsibility of locally multiplying the seed that was brought in through the ICRISAT initiative in collaboration with Matopo Research, with a view to making it locally available for farmers. In addition to growing fodder crops farmers have also been trained in low cost techniques for preserving and enhancing the nutritional value of crop residue such as maize stover. Techniques such as urea treatment are now being used by farmers to transform unpalatable, low nutritional value crop residues into high quality feeds that are appropriate for livestock earmarked for sale. Bales of properly preserved fodder can be kept for years without losing nutritional value, serving as a valuable emergency feed in the event of droughts or veld fires. Farmers producing more than they need are now selling excess fodder to their neighbours, thereby diversifying their income base. With some farmers having as many as 200 herd of cattle, the stakes are high.

One section is devoted to how agroforestry can be practised by deliberately integrating woody perennials (e.g., trees, shrubs, palms or bamboos) and agricultural crops or animals on the same piece of land in some form of spatial and temporal arrangement. In this context, the importance of trees for human well-being and how they provide humans with good and services (forest ecosystem goods and services for household consumption, including food, fuelwood and medicines) is discussed. The discussion also goes into how the planting of trees in croplands increases the absorptive capacity of the soil and reduces evapotranspiration, raindrop impact, soil erosion and the soil temperature of the crops planted beneath.

Ponds may be designed in such a way that they can be rain-fed (sky ponds) and/or may have inlet and outlet systems for controlled water circulation. The water supply may be from a stream or a canal or from underground sources such as wells. The water retentivity of the ponds depends on soil composition of the pond bottom and subsoil water level. The sandier, the soil, the less likely it is to retain water in the pond system. In order to enhance production, pond aquaculture systems may require liming (to balance the water pH), application of manure and/or fertilisers (based on pond soil and water quality), stocking of fingerlings, regular supplementary feeding of fish, and harvesting of fish at the right time. Most of the training and capacity building of aquaculture in Zimbabwe is currently based on pond culture as it is a simple form of production which is cost-effective.

On the other hand, energy generated from fossil fuels results in emissions of greenhouse gases which are linked to climate change. Therefore this chapter endeavours to advocate renewable forms of energy which have a benign effect on climate change. These renewable sources of energy are the sun (solar energy), wind, water and geothermal energy. The intensive use of energy in modern agriculture calls for judicious management of traditional forms of energy, coupled with the accelerated diffusion of technologies that are related to renewable forms of energy. This is imperative for sustainable food production. The chapter assesses the extent to which renewable energies and energy management opportunities can support the triple-win strategy being promoted through the CSA concept. The combination of renewable energy and improvements in efficiency contribute to all three pillars of CSA, i.e., improving productivity, climate resilience and reducing emissions from fossil fuel utilisation. Zimbabwe has a high potential for the exploitation of renewable energy. A number of solar PV projects have been implemented demonstrating the suitability, sustainability and economic convenience of off-grid solar power installations. Other projects that have shown good results are biomass use from wood waste, bagasse, and biogas generation from bio-digesters. Although the average wind speed in Zimbabwe (3m/s) is relatively low, developments in wind technology make power generation and water pumping feasible.
