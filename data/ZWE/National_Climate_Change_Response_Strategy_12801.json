The challenge for the country is how to develop adaptation strategies that can reduce and mitigate the diverse and complex impacts of climate change. The National Climate Change Response Strategy is a response to this challenge and also aims to contribute towards achieving Zimbabwe’s Agenda for Sustainable Socio-Economic Transformation (Zim Asset) 2013-2018 and beyond. The Zim Asset recognises that the country is susceptible to perennial droughts and floods caused by climate change emanating from global warming. It also notes that climate change affects the country’s agro-based economy whose livelihoods largely depend on rain-fed agriculture, livestock production and natural resources.
