It encourages private sector financing. It states that private sector installers of so- lar systems will be supported to access low-cost financing from development finance institutions and the CBN in order to install solar systems at an affordable price.The plan also addresses science and technology, especially by integrate its use in the agricultural, housing,  roads and solar power projects.
