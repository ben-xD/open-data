The plan explicitly identifies climate change as one of the major threats to economic development goals and food security. To meet these challenges, the plan includes concrete targets in the areas of climate change adaptation, afforestation, and energy supply. The vision of the National Climate Change Policy Response and Strategy (NCCPRS) is a climate change-resilient Nigeria ready for rapid and sustainable socio-economic development. Its mission is to strengthen national initiatives to adapt to and mitigate climate change and involve all sectors of society, including the poor and other vulnerable groups (women, youth etc.) within the overall context of advancing sustainable socio-economic development. Its main objectives are :&nbsp;<br><br>1) Implement mitigation measures that will promote low carbon as well as sustainable and high economic growth<br>2) Strengthen national capacity to adapt to climate change;<br>3) Raise climate change-related science, technology and R&amp;D to a new level that will enable the country to better participate in international scientific and technological co-operation on climate change;<br>&nbsp;4) Significantly increase public awareness and involve the private sector in addressing the challenges of climate change;<br>&nbsp;5) Strengthen national institutions and mechanisms (policy, legislative and economic) to establish a suitable and functional framework for climate change Governance.<br><br>The current version of the policy was approved by Nigeria's president on June 2, 2021, and covers the period 2021-2030."}
