Its once thriving phosphate industry has ceased operation thus depriving Nauru of its major lifeline revenue source.

However, further explorations of the residual phosphate deposits have raised hopes that there may be potential to keep the phosphate mining for yet sometime. With fewer prospects in the phosphate industry, Nauru has to look at other alternative revenue sources to support its economic development. Unfortunately, for a country of the size of Nauru (21 km) with its limited natural resources, the options are not many. Some measures taken by the Government of Nauru (GoN) to improve its revenue earning power have been considered unusual. For example following the decline in phosphate revenue in the early 1990s the GoN declared itself a tax haven and become susceptible to money laundering activities. And since 2001, it has played host to an Australian offshore detention centre that holds and processes asylum seekers trying to enter Australia. Nauru now is highly dependent on donor support especially from Australia, Japan, New Zealand and Taiwan (ROC).
