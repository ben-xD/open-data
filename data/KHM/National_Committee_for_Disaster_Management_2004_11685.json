Each year, such flooding causes the loss of life of property, hinders agricultural production, and causes destruction to public infrastructure. Cambodia's vast flood plain is one of the country's most prominent geographical features, making large portions of the country prone to flooding by the Mekong River and from heavy rainfall. The majority of Cambodians living in these low-lying areas depend upon subsistence farming for their livelihoods. Thus, the yearly occurrence of floods and other disasters result in grave consequences for rural population throughout the country in terms of maintaining a secure level of sustenance.
