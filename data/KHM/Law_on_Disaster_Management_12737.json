with 1) Prevention, adaptation and mitigation in the pre-disaster period, due to natural or human-made causes, 2) Emergency response during the disaster, and 3) Recovery in the post-disaster period.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;The Law further creates the National Committee for Disaster Management. Sub-committees at national and regional levels will ensure the completion of the Committee's missions. On July 22, 2020, the National Committee for Disaster Management launched the Platform for Real-time Impact and Situation Monitoring (PRISM)."}
