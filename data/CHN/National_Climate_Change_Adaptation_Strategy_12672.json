It outlines a wide range of measures to be implemented by 2020 in order to protect water resources, minimise soil erosion and strengthen disaster prevention, such as early-warning detection and information-sharing mechanisms at the national and provincial levels, ocean disaster monitoring system and coastal restoration. To reduce climate impacts in agriculture the Chinese government plans to develop new farming practices, including controlling plant-eating pests and improving crop adaptability.  The plan also includes weather-based financial instruments such as catastrophe bonds and weather index-based insurance."}
