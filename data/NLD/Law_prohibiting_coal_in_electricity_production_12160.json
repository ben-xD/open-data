Article 2 states that it is prohibited to generate electricity in a production installation using coal. The law grants plants built in the 1990s up to 2025 to cease operations, while newer ones will have until 2030 to do so.&nbsp;<br><br>On December 22, 2021, the Dutch cabinet restricted emissions from coal-fired power stations by limiting their operations to no more than 35% of their maximum capacity. The government estimates it will result in a&nbsp; reduction in CO2 emissions at coal-fired power stations of approximately 6-7 megatons \"in the short term\". The amendment to the Coal Act came into effect on 1 January 2022 and will apply until the end of 2024."}
