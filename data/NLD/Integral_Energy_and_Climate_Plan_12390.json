The limited availability of renewable sources in the Netherlands is an important point of concern. Since the Netherlands is located along the coast and the wind is relatively strong, this offers potential for wind energy on land and offshore; 3) a transition to an emission-free mobility system that involves sustainable energy carriers (electricity, biofuels and green hydrogen); 4) homes and other building will be made more energy-efficient  in a sustainable transformation of the built-up environment; 5) to promote a robust and sustainable agriculture which adopts a more efficient approach to raw materials and the environment."}
