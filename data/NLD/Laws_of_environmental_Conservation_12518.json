It is also the legal basis to enforce commitments by companies not covered under the ETS that are undertaken within Long-Term Agreements and the Benchmarking Covenant.  The Act lays out enforcement of legal measures, allocating responsibilities for enforcement and monitoring among authorities. Sanctioning options include demanding compliance at the expense of the violator, financial penalties, withdrawal of operating licences and criminal sanctions such as high financial penalties or imprisonment up to six years."}
