The report looked at the share of disposable income a household spends on energy (the energy ratio) and the extent to which a household has money left over for basic living expenses after housing and energy costs (the payment risk). PBL is introducing a methodology for determining the average energy bill per income group, in which the Netherlands is divided into five income groups. If disposable income minus the actual net cost of energy and housing is less than the minimum standard amount for (other) basic costs, the household will not be left with enough at the end of the month to cover basic living costs.
