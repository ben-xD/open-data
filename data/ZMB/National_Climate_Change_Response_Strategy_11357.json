The Strategy seeks to provide Zambia with a prosperous Climate Change Resilient Economy, by ensuring that the most vulnerable sectors of the economy are climate proofed, and sustainable development achieved through the promotion of low carbon development pathways. This document is articulated to a number of other strategy papers, including the National Long Term Vision 2030 and the Sixth National Development Plan.&nbsp;<br><br>The document emphasises on the development of agriculture as the main engine of income expansion. Infrastructure, tourism, manufacturing, mining and energy are also prioritised. The strategy aims more specifically to 1) develop sustainable land use systems to enhance agricultural production and ensure food security under the changing climate, 2) ensure sustainable management and resiliency of water resources under the changing climate, 3) protect people and health from climate change and climate variability, 4) to climate proof infrastructure, 5) develop a less carbon-intensive and climate change-resilient transport system, 6) develop a less carbon-intensive and climate change-resilient energy infrastructure and grow using low carbon path, 7) develop a less carbon-intensive and climate change-resilient mining industry, 8) develop an appropriate climate change governance framework, and 9) mainstream climate change in all the key sectors of the economy."}
