It aims to strengthen individual and institutional systemic capacities of the energy, health, forestry, agriculture and education sectors to enable them deliver climate change learning and contribute to the implementation of the NDC and NAPs.&nbsp;<br><br>The strategy covers the period up to 2030. Priority actions are phased as short term (1-2 years); medium term (3-5 years); and long term (6-10 years). Each of the five sectors will deal with the three national priority actions: 1) awareness raising and knowledge strengthening; 2) individual and institutional capacity building and 3) mainstreaming climate change learning into the priority sector policies and systems in the short, medium and long-terms."}
