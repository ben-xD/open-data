However, the amounts and unpredictability of budgetary releases negatively affected programme implementation and achievement of desired outputs and outcomes. A detailed analysis of expenditure revealed that programmes were not funded as provided for in these previous Development Plans. This was partly due to funds not being availed on time to Ministries, Provinces and other Spending Agencies (MPSAs). In addition, there was a noticeable mismatch between the programmes contained in the annual budgets and plans to an extent that even when resources were released for programmes, there were variations that led to resources being expended on non-core activities of the Plans. Further, despite the Plans having increased allocations to sectors targeting human development, the allocations in the budgets were not sufficient to implement most development programmes."}, {"text_block_id": "p21_b57", "text": "The Plans were also affected by failure to fully implement the Decentralisation Policy, especially fiscal decentralisation, despite the approval of both the policy and its implementation plan. They were further affected by poor coordination among various implementing entities and stakeholders mainly due to limitations in the institutional arrangements and technical capacities. There was also poor uptake of results which led to implementing agencies not having timely policy guidance with regard to the implementation of the Plans. This was because of poor appreciation of monitoring and evaluation (M&E) in MPSAs for internal use, coupled with fragmented systems within and between Ministries.

The FNDP, SNDP and R-SNDP were structured as both policy and investment plans. However, there were too many designated priority sectors, and this resulted in thinly spreading of resources with minimal impact.

The formulation of the Plan was guided by the National Planning and Budgeting Policy of 2014, while the Decentralisation Policy of 2014 provided the principles of implementation.

Arising from the chosen theme, the goal of the 7NDP is to create a diversified and resilient economy for sustained growth and socio-economic transformation driven, among others, by agriculture. The realisation of this goal will be achieved through the contribution of a number of developmental outcomes. The key outcomes include economic diversification and job creation; reduction of poverty and vulnerability; reduced developmental inequalities; enhanced human development; and the creation of a conducive governance environment for a diversified and inclusive economy.
