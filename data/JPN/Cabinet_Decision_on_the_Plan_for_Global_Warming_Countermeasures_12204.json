The Plan is the legal and administration backbone for domestic implementation of Japanese emission reduction goals.The plan defines a path to achieve a mid-term target of 26% greenhouse gas emission reduction by 2030 compared to 2013, clarifying cross-cutting policies and measures to be implemented, and also sets a long-term goal to pursue 80% reduction by 2050.This plan lays down the foundations to the future progress of global warming countermeasures in Japan. Monitoring and evaluation mechanism inherent in the plan is a critical point for the steady implementation. The progress of actions will be reviewed every year, and the plan itself will be evaluated every three years."}
