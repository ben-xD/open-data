To do so, it aims to create smart food value chains, boost human development, boost research and development, and encourage innovation, notably in rural areas. It also sets specific measures to decarbonise the food sector and make it more resilient.The document also 1) encourages circular economy with increased use of local resources, 2) aims to contribute to the 2050 goal of carbon neutrality via a reduction in the use of chemical pesticides/fertilisers, , and 3) seeks to disseminate energy saving/precision technologies.On top of a sectoral carbon neutral target, the strategy sets the following goals by 2050:- 50% reduction in risk-weighted use of chemical pesticides by dissemination of the Integrated Pest Management and newly-developed alternatives- 30% reduction in chemical fertilizer use - Increase in organic farming to 1Mha- At least 30% enhancement in productivity of food manufacturers (by 2030)- Sustainable sourcing for import materials (by2030)- 90% and more superior varieties and F1 plus trees in forestry seedling- 100% of artificial seedling rates in aquaculture of Japanese eel, Pacific bluefin tuna, etc."}
