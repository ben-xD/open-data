The process aims to position the PRSP under review in the long term. The idea is to match the new PRSP•s strategies with the real aspirations of Cameroonians over a long period of time with a view to foresee structural changes in society. These changes are evidenced in four factors which at the same time account for the formulation of the long-term vision and pose as challenges to the process. After reviewing these factors, the document addresses the formulation of the vision, its implementation strategies, as well as related threats, risks and obstacles."}, {"text_block_id": "p5_b29", "text": "1. Stakes"}, {"text_block_id": "p5_b30", "text": "The first challenge is to consolidate democracy and enhance national unity. Cameroon is an ethnic and linguistic mosaic with other divergent factors such as religion, politics, corporation, etc. Building a Nation •State out of such diversity is often hampered by some centrifugal forces and tendencies towards identity confinement. Despite the progress made so far, the consolidation of achievements in the areas of national integration, peace, justice, social cohesion and democratization continue to be a challenge. At the political level in particular, consolidating the democratization process implies the existence of a constitutional State, promotion and respect for individual and collective freedoms, power separation, the emergence of a strong and accountable civil society and participation of all Cameroonians in public affairs management."}, {"text_block_id": "p5_b31", "text": "Economic growth and employment constitute another challenge. Despite the gradual recovery from the devaluation of the CFA franc in 1994, Cameroon•s growth is still to find its strength in terms of its inner dynamics and the expected impact on the living conditions of the population. An analysis of the country•s growth factors reveals that its economy depends more than 50 per cent on Household and Sole Proprietor Businesses which constitute a sector comprising mostly informal units (notably agriculture and trade) with no guarantee of sustainable growth due to their generally fluctuating performances. Cameroon has been unable to develop a competitive industrial sector especially because of its poor performance in the global economy and lack of an operational potential at the domestic level. This problem is also compounded by distribution of the wealth generated. As a matter of fact, dividends on share capital continue to have an edge over salaries and other social contributions. There is hence a general outcry for strong growth with an equitable distribution of its fallouts."}, {"text_block_id": "p5_b32", "text": "The third challenge is socio-demographic. Population explosion in Cameroon has led to an increase in the number of dependent people (young and old), and changed the density of settlements. There is need for more infrastructure and social services to match the increasing numbers of young people, especially in the education and health sectors. The youth provide an important manpower not absorbable into the formal economic sector and thus turn to the informal sector for poorly paid jobs not matching their professional skills. The vision has as challenge to make the population of Cameroon a driving force of its development through controlled population growth, human capital formation and a longer life expectancy."}, {"text_block_id": "p5_b33", "text": "Urban and regional development is the fourth challenge. If current trends persist, over 75 per cent of Cameroon•s population will in the next 25-30 years live in urban areas. If pre-emptive action is not taken, the problems resulting from rapid and uncontrolled urban expansion already plaguing Douala and Yaounde might spread like wildfire. For the vision, the issue at stake is how to plan the all-so-important development of towns and cities which are major consumption centres and a gold mine for industrial development factors."}, {"text_block_id": "p5_b34", "text": "The last challenge is governance.

The status of middle income country will concretize the objective of doubling at least the average income to ensure that Cameroon progresses from a low income to a middle income country by enhancing growth to a two-digit level by 2017 and maintaining this level for a number of years. At the industrial level, Cameroon•s ambition is to transform from a primary phase to a secondary import substitution phase with the manufacturing industry accounting for more than 23 per cent of the GDP, as against the current 11 per cent and a secondary sector as a whole (including extractive industries) accounting for 40 per cent of the GDP.

Secondly, the government will look for ways and means to maintain growth at high levels, to achieve Millennium Development Goals no matter how late and to ensure that the population is entirely mobilized in the fight against climate change effects. The third step will coincide with the time when Cameroon becomes an emerging country, open to the outward world and relying on its production and export pattern that is essentially based on industries.

Over exploitation of natural resources and environmental costs have been warned as it results in climate change threats; Cameroon is partly located in Sahel area with existing harmful effects of climate change: desert encroachment, increased temperatures, irregular seasons, sea level rise, floods, volcanism, landslides rock fall and toxic fumes. The document calls for reduction of greenhouse gases to tackle climate change as a key regional strategy for Cameroon. The Government of Cameroon pledges to seek high growth level while achieving Millennium Development Goals.\n\nUnder the tentative implementation schedule of Vision 2035, drafting and implementation of major environmental policy to fight against the climate change impact is planned for the phase one (2010-2019). Climate change control is listed as one of the three specific objectives for the phase two (2020-2027). Specific actions include protecting and ensuring sustainable management of forest ecosystems, fighting desert encroachment and promoting regional projects like the Niger Basin and the Lake Chad Basin.Diversification of energy source and replacement of fossil fuel with clean energy supplies is mentioned in the document without quantitative targets."}
