Malawi’s heavyreliance on rain-fed agriculture renders thecountry reliant on seasonal livelihoods and onerainy season. Moreover, the heavy dependenceon maize limits options even further. Even undernormal circumstances rural smallholder farmersface seasonal shocks and may remain in poverty,or move, and then fall back depending on theyear. This situation has become worse and worsedue the impacts of climate change. The mostrecent flood and droughts left approximately 6.7million people food and nutrition insecure. Otherenvironmental shocks that affect Malawi includelandslides, forest fires, pest infestations and cropdisease, and earthquakes, as well as economicshocks. These shocks are driven by a highdependence on the agricultural sector, which hasbecome increasingly unstable due weather-related events. Compared to 2014, inflationrates in 2015 were lower for the first quarter butwere then driven upwards – predominantly by ashortage of food supply. The inflation rate forfood was 23.9% while non-food items was20.0%. Inflation for non-food items was catalysedby speculation by banks and the strengthening ofthe US dollar. Projections indicate that inflationrates will be lower than 10% by 2018 (AnnualEconomic Report, 2016). Despite importantprogress, the agricultural sector operates farbelow its capacity and the country continuouslyfaces food shortages at national and householdlevels. Agriculture remains critical for achievingnational development objectives such as broad-based growth, diversification of production andexports,povertyreduction,employment,smallholder farmer income generation andfood/nutrition security."}, {"text_block_id": "p19_b3", "text": "Malawi ranks 173 of 188 countries andterritories in the 2014 Human DevelopmentIndex, with a population of 17.4 million.
