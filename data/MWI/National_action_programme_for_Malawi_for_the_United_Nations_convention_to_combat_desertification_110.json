In May 1974 the United Nations General Assembly recommended that the international community undertake concrete and speedy measures to arrest desertification and assist the economic development of affected areas.  In December 1974 the General Assembly decided to initiate concerted international effort to combat desertification and, in order to provide impetus to this end, the United Nations Conference on Desertification (UNCOD), was held in Nairobi, 29 August to 9 September 1977.  The conference established that desertification was one of the major environmental and natural resource degradation problems of the globe and that its costs in human, social and economic terms were extremely high. UNCOD adopted a Plan of Action to Combat Desertification (PACD) with 28 recommendations.  This was followed by three expert studies in 1978, 1980 and 1981 under General Assembly guidance."}, {"text_block_id": "p8_b237", "text": "In 1989 the General Assembly requested the Secretary-General, in consultation with the Executive Director of UNEP, to submit to the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED) a report containing relevant expert studies.

The UNCED (the so called Earth Summit) held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in June 1992, offered an opportunity for world leaders to consider international laws for managing natural resources and their processes, in a new, integrated approach to the problem emphasising action to promote sustainable development at the community level. One of the most significant agreements reached at Rio was the decision to elaborate an international convention to combat desertification.

The convention entered into force on 26th December 1996, 90 days after the 50th ratification was received, and the first session of Conference of the Parties (COP) was held in October 1997.

The NEAP describes the environmental situation in Malawi and outlines a series of actions that should be taken in order to redress the aggravating degradation and bring the utilization of natural resources within sustainable limits.  Nine key environmental issues were identified, namely: soil erosion, deforestation, water resources depletion and degradation, high population growth, depletion of fish stocks, threats to biodiversity, human habitat degradation, climate change, and air pollution. The process used to identify issues and the issues that have come up in the CCD consultations are similar to those from the NEAP.  However, the activities identified for implementation of the CCD will be complimentary to the NEAP rather than a duplication since implementing sectors participated fully in the whole process of consultations.
