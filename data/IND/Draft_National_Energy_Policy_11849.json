It received Cabinet approval in 2008.  In relation to renewable energy, the policy proposed:The phase-out of capital subsidies by the end of the 10th Plan linked to creation of renewable grid power capacityRequiring power regulators to seek alternative incentive structures that encourage utilities to integrate wind, small hydro, cogeneration and so on into their systems, and the linking of all such incentives to energy generated as opposed to capacity createdRequiring power regulators to mandate feed-in laws for renewable energy, where appropriate, as provided under the Electricity Act 2003.
