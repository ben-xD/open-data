The challenge is to ensure adequate supply of energy at the least possible cost.

India needs to sustain an 8% to 10% economic growth rate, over the next 25 years, if it is to eradicate poverty and meet its human development goals. To deliver a sustained growth rate of 8% through 2031-32 and to meet the lifeline energy needs of all citizens, India needs, at the very least, to increase its primary energy supply by 3 to 4 times and, its electricity generation capacity/supply by 5 to 6 times of their 2003-04 levels. With 200304 as the base, India’s commercial energy supply would need to grow from 5.2% to 6.1% per annum while its total primary energy supply would need to grow at 4.3% to 5.1% annually. By 2031-32 power generation capacity must increase to nearly 8,00,000 MW from the current capacity of around 1,60,000 MW inclusive of all captive plants. Similarly requirement of coal, the dominant fuel in India’s energy mix will need to expand to over 2 billion tonnes/annum based on domestic quality of coal. Meeting the energy challenge is of fundamental importance to India’s economic growth imperatives and its efforts to raise its level of human development."}, {"text_block_id": "p13_b76", "text": "The broad vision behind the energy policy is to reliably meet the demand for energy services of all sectors at competitive prices. Further, lifeline energy needs of all households must be met even if that entails directed subsidies to vulnerable households. The demand must be met through safe, clean and convenient forms of energy at the least-cost in a technically efficient, economically viable and environmentally sustainable manner."}, {"text_block_id": "p13_b77", "text": "Considering the shocks and disruptions that can be reasonably expected, assured supply of such energy and technologies at all times is essential to providing energy security for all. Meeting this vision requires that India pursues all available fuel options and forms of energy, both conventional and non-conventional. Further, India must seek to expand its energy resource base and seek new and emerging energy sources. Finally, and most importantly, India must pursue technologies that maximise energy efficiency, demand side management and conservation. Coal shall remain India’s most important energy source till 2031-32 and possibly beyond. Thus, India must seek clean coal combustion technologies and, given the growing demand for coal, also pursue new coal extraction technologies such as in-situ gasification to tap its vast coal reserves that are difficult to extract economically using conventional technologies."}, {"text_block_id": "p13_b78", "text": "The approach of the Committee is directed to realising a cost-effective energy system.

Social objectives should ideally be met through direct transfers. Environmental externalities should be treated uniformly and internalised. A consistent application of “polluter pays” principle may be made to attain environmental objectives at least-cost where prescribed environmental norms are either not applied consistently or not being adhered to.

With an ash content of over 40% and a calorific value averaging only 3500 kcal/ kg., most of the coal sold to the power sector would have to be “prepared” to be made tradable. This would entail both cost and additional investment. In international trade, shipping and handling of coal typically accounts for 30-35% of the cost of coal with an average calorific value of about 6000 kcal/kg. In India transport and handling costs can reach 200% to 300% of the pit head price of coal when moved to Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Goa, Gujarat, Rajasthan, Delhi, Haryana, Punjab and parts of UP. This reinforces the need for washing and preparation of coal by the coal supplier since high grade energy used for traction is used to transport a low grade fuel and useless ash. Further, it brings into focus the need to gradually decrease cross subsidies in railways since the rail freight for coal and other commodities is higher than what can be economically justified.

Minister and Deputy Chair of the Planning Commission, an expert committee was established to develop a comprehensive energy policy in 2004. The Integrated Energy Policy, released in August 2006, addresses all aspects of energy, including energy security, access and availability, affordability and pricing, efficiency and the environment.  The Policy aims to meet energy demand 'at the least cost in a technically efficient, economically viable and environmentally sustainable manner'. It contains a number of policies that contribute to avoiding GHG emissions. It received Cabinet approval in 2008.  In relation to renewable energy, the policy proposed:The phase-out of capital subsidies by the end of the 10th Plan linked to creation of renewable grid power capacityRequiring power regulators to seek alternative incentive structures that encourage utilities to integrate wind, small hydro, cogeneration and so on into their systems, and the linking of all such incentives to energy generated as opposed to capacity createdRequiring power regulators to mandate feed-in laws for renewable energy, where appropriate, as provided under the Electricity Act 2003. The policy also made a range of more specific recommendations in relation to particular renewable energy sources, including mini hydro, wind and wood gasification power  The Energy Co-ordination Committee (under the chairmanship of the prime minister) oversees implementation of the policy."}
