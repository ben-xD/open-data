Energy Efficient technologies also have higher efficiency operating characteristics, they tend to last longer and thus reducing the operation and maintenance cost. This is especially true for programs that encourage the use of high efficiency heating, cooling, and ventilation equipment (HVAC), energy efficient lighting, fans and motors.

The Government of India’s ambitious plan of having RES capacity of 175 GW by March, 2022 has accelerated the capacity addition from Renewable Energy Sources(RES). The capacity addition from RES has opened up opportunities as well as challenges. A distinct difference exists between conventional generating plants and RES. The generation from the conventional plants can be programmed to vary as per the requirement of loads. That is why it is called dispatchable generation. Generation from Variable Renewable Energy Sources is independent of the electricity demand of the grid and is called non-dispatchable. Further variability and uncertainty are the two aspects associated with generation from Variable Renewable Energy (VRE). Variability refers to the variation of generation over a period of time. For example, generation from solar plants is expected to follow a fixed pattern like maximum generation during noon time and “NIL” at night. Similarly, generation from wind follows seasonal pattern-maximum during monsoon. Uncertainty refers to the unpredictability of generation from VRE. For example, generation from solar plants are expected to be maximum during noon. But due to cloud cover, the generation may get affected. This is the uncertainty part of solar generation. Furthermore, in conventional power plants, power generated from the plants are transported through high voltage transmission links and then distributed to the consumers through distribution networks. In case of RES, the generating plants may be mostly at the distribution levels or at customers ends. There may again be bi-directional flow of electricity-from grid to customers and from customers to the grid. Again, as the generation from VRE are variable and uncertain, requisite balancing power from conventional sources is required to be made available as reserve to ensure that demand at any time is fully met. Another aspect that needs consideration is that the generation from solar plants peaks when the demand during the day is minimum and has “ZERO” generation at the evening when the load on the grid is maximum. This requires fast ramping up capabilities of conventional generators. Therefore, integrating this VRE sources into the existing grid offers a challenge. The basic principle governing integration of VRE sources into the grid is to ensure the integrity, security and reliability of the grid. More than anything else, integration of VRE into the grid poses technological and operational challenges."}, {"text_block_id": "p16_b15", "text": "Provided that the Authority while preparing the National Electricity Plan shall publish the draft National Electricity Plan and invite suggestions and objections thereon from licensees, generating companies and the public within such time as may be prescribed: Provided further that the Authority shall"}, {"text_block_id": "p249_b15", "text": "erm PPA’s"}, {"text_block_id": "p350_b15", "text": "(Figures in Thousand)"}, {"text_block_id": "p152_b15", "text": "Financial Parameter"}, {"text_block_id": "p101_b15", "text": "3.1 ENERGY CONSERVATION ACT AND FORMATION OF BUREAU OF ENERGY EFFICIENCY"}, {"text_block_id": "p16_b16", "text": "–"}, {"text_block_id": "p249_b16", "text": "."}, {"text_block_id": "p350_b16", "text": "Manpower recouped considering 7.5% Manpower recouped due to decommissioning @ 1.5% per year are shown in"}, {"text_block_id": "p152_b16", "text": "(Figures in %)"}, {"text_block_id": "p101_b16", "text": "Considering vast energy saving potential and in order to bring a movement in energy conservation and energy efficiency in different end-uses in the country, the Government of India enacted the Energy Conservation (EC)Act, 2001 for providing sustainable and more efficient management of our energy resources.
