Part. 6.6.2 focuses on disaster risk management and adaptation. A list of sectoral and institutional actions to enable disaster risk management is laid out.\n\nPriority mitigation activities include an enhancement of REDD+ projects to reduce emissions and the establishment of sustainable financial mechanisms. The government is encouraged to find a way to integrate REDD+ projects into international carbon trade mechanisms.\n\nAims for the agricultural sector include the development of cultivation areas for renewable energy crops such as oleaginous fruit trees.\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 150\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n\n\n\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>"}
