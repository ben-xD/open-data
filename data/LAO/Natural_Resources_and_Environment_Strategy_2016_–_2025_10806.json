The unique characteristic of this soil is well solid, small underground water activities, washout of all fertile surface soils leaving only poor nutrient sub-level during heavy rains. This type of land is located in the five Northern provinces: LPB, HP, PXL, OUX and LNT. In additions, the conversion process of fallow forests, which almost have only sand on their top-surface and laterite (gravel stones) or salted water on the sub-level, is for the agricultural purposes, for instance, 772,762 ha of fallow forests located in Utumphone, Adsapangthong and Sonbury district of Savannakhet province. Most of these areas were already converted into agricultural lands, causing the lack of surface forest coverage, destruction of soil structure, insufficiency of soil moisturizing and occurrence of laterite on the surface leading to future agricultural problems. The result of this negative development is increased global as well as local negative climate impact, loss of biodiversity and loss of generation of local livelihood. The fallow forests in Vientiane Province have salted groundwater reserves but with lots of agricultural activities, the soil would eventually be in the same situation.
