The regulations outline a 'star rating' from 1-5 as well as minimum levels that specific electrical appliances must achieve (for example, domestic fans must achieve a MEPS of two stars).Efficient Management of Electrical Energy Regulation 2008: Under the regulation, all installations that consume 3 million kWh or more of electricity over six months must have an electrical energy manager. The energy manager is responsible for analysing the total consumption of electrical energy, advising on the development and implementation of measures to ensure efficient management of electrical energy and monitoring the effectiveness of the measures taken."}
