Their protection and sustainable management must therefore be ensured.\n\nArt. 14 states that the Forestry Administration is responsible for implementing any measures necessary for the protection, sustainable development of Guinean forests and trees outside forests, the conservation of plant diversity, the mitigation of the impacts of climate change and the certification of forest products harvested.\n\nArt. 21 mentions that areas stabilising water regimes and the climate can be classified as forests, or enjoy similar legal status.\n\nArt. 46 states that in order to estimating the carbon stored in forest ecosystems and woodlands as part of the mitigation of climate change impacts, as well as for wood energy assessment, the inventory of plant biomass is the responsibility of the owner of the forest, under the control of the Administration in charge of Forests.\n\nArt. 115 grants the Forestry Administration the power of prescribing protective measures to be taken in forest lands where they are required, notably to curb GHG emissions."}
