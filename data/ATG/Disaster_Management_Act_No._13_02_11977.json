The 2002 Act aims to provide for the effective organisation of the preparedness, management, mitigation of, response to and recovery from emergencies and disasters from natural and man-made origins in the country. It creates the National Disaster Preparedness and Response Advisory Committee and mandates the appointment of a Director of Disaster Preparedness and Response. It defines a series of measures in relation with disaster preparedness and management. This Act and the Emergency Powers Act (1967) and the Emergency Powers (Hurricane, Earthquake, Fire or Flood) Act (1957) should be considered together."}
