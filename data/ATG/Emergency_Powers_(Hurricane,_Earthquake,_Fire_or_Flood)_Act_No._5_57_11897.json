declare by Proclamation in the Gazette a state of emergency in case of occurrence in Antigua and Barbuda of a hurricane, earthquake, fire or flood and grants extraordinary powers of legislation in such circumstances. The Cabinet may, among other things, by order, provide for the regulation or requisitioning of food and water and for the requisitioning of or entry upon private land. This Act should be considered jointly with the Emergency Powers Act (1967) and the Disaster Management Act (2002). The 2002 Act aims to provide for the effective organisation of the preparedness, management, mitigation of, response to and recovery from emergencies and disasters from natural and man-made origins in the country. It creates the National Disaster Preparedness and Response Advisory Committee and mandates the appointment of a Director of Disaster Preparedness and Response. It defines a series of measures in relation with disaster preparedness and management. This Act and the Emergency Powers Act (1967) and the Emergency Powers (Hurricane, Earthquake, Fire or Flood) Act (1957) should be considered together."}
