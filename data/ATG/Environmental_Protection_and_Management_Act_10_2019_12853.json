It seeked to associate different kinds of non-governmental entities to its preventive and remedial decisions, and awareness-raising measures. The Act formulated a legal right for access to information related to the local environment in its various forms. The document charged the government to develop a National Environmental Policy Framework to implement specific objectives within the scope of the Act, and notably the reduction of greenhouse gases emissions. It further allowed the government to declare an area protected if the function of carbon sink is identified following the UNFCCC principles, and to monitor the given area."}
