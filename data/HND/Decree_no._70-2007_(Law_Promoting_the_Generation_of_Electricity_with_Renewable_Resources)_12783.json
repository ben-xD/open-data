In order to reach that objective, the law seeks to 1) ease investment rules for the sector, 2) ease permitting procedures, 3) create rural jobs, 4) increase efficiency of the country's electricity supply system, 5) raise wellbeing in rural areas thanks to renewable resources, and 6) look for more alternative sources of energy. Article 2 details a number of tax exemptions for entities invovled in renewable energy projects. Article 3 defines the rules allowing private companies that produce and consume renewable energy sources to sell the unconsumed electricity through the grid. Article 6 creates the Fund for the development of electricity generation from renewable sources.\n\nThe law further expresses the state's commitment to legally and financially help renewable energy projects. Chapter II, III and IV focus on the reform of the electricity generation and supply markets. Chapter V sets that the national company of electric energy will benefit from all the rules decided in this law. Following chapters redefine the permitting framework around the use of natural resources."}
