The sizing of the refinery at 50,000 bpd is consistent with Myanmar’squota of Arab heavy sour oil, furthermore, the liquid fuel demand of the transport sector requires abalanced production of gasoline and diesel fuel which leads to efficient refinery operation.

An econometric analysis of 80 countries, using time series data drawn from the WorldBank’s Development Indicators, found that GDP growth precedes energy growth. In the transitionalphase from developing to middle income country status, traditional activities result in the accumulationof wealth that is later channelled into investment in energy infrastructure. In the longer term the natureof economic activity changes to become highly energy dependent; additional energy must be providedbefore further economic growth can take place. Energy intensity, a measure of energy input per unit ofGDP, typically increases during the transition from a developing to middle income status. In fact,Myanmar’s energy intensity trend of recent years has shown a decline; however, this appears to reflectthe impact of gas sales on GDP because gas production and sales is not an energy intensive activity."}, {"text_block_id": "p52_b4", "text": "3.Strong economic growth is anticipated by the Asian Development Bank in all sectors of theeconomy.

Secondary Sector. The prospect for economic growth led by industrialization appears tobe mixed. In mining, Myanmar is endowed with a wide variety of mineral deposits. However,the proven reserves are relatively small by comparison to those of countries that currentlydominate each mineral market. Moreover, Myanmar’s large mineral deposits are located inremote areas of the country where there is currently no rail or road infrastructure. In the caseof mineral processing, the production of iron and steel, copper concentrate, tin and tungstenconcentrate is well established in Myanmar. Mineral processing in Myanmar is undertaken atthe mine-mouth and production levels are dictated by local market demand. Given the scaleof mining in Myanmar, it seems likely that minerals processing will continue to develop toservice local market demands. Companies with established footholds in Myanmar’s miningindustry will continue to lead the way through small-scale mining ventures. It follows that overthe long-term the mining industry is likely to grow at a modest pace. One of the unusualfeatures of Myanmar’s heavy industry sector is the dominance of the cement industry in theuse of energy; this reflects the local nature of the existing industry structure. In the power, oiland gas sector, Myanmar’s willingness to sell oil and gas to its near neighbours impacts GDPgrowth in two ways, firstly in terms of royalties, taxes and employment and secondly in termsof the oil and gas that is secured from international investors for the purposes of localconsumption. Where foreign investors develop oil and gas fields for export, it is only theallocation of the energy carriers reserved for national energy supply that are of directrelevance to national energy planning. Given that a significant proportion of the oil and gasbeing produced in Myanmar is being sold internationally, there is clearly a need to considerhow electricity production can be increased economically with available resources and how itwill be best to supply petroleum products to address local production to serve growingdemand. Strong growth is expected in the power and gas sector, albeit dependent on aninjection of substantial foreign direct investment (FDI). The construction sector will needcopper wire; bricks; glass and cement (aluminium products will continue to be imported);clearly the production of these products will rely on energy intensive local industries that inturn will rely on stable energy supplies.

Even if the MyanmarPetroleum Enterprise decides to upgrade at least one of the existing refineries, the throughput willnot be sufficient to cover the increasing demand; hence the strategy for liquid fuels must be basedon construction of new capacity and / or by importing. Myanmar has the right to use 50 000 bbl/dayof the transfer capacity of the Sino-Burma pipeline, which could be used as a feedstock for apotential new refinery. For the imports there are initial plans for a new import terminal, which could ata later stage support a new local refinery. However, it is believed that a small scale coastal refinerymay not be economically feasible under the competitive pressure from large, world class refineries inthe Middle East, India and Southeast Asia.

In terms of energy and food ‘security, the rivers form a particularly critical resource.Unfortunately, the two forms of security seem not to be complementary, but largely contradictory:increasing energy security through large-scale hydropower could radically reduce the food security.Based on impact assessments done on the dams in Mekong, the construction of mainstream damswill affect fish biodiversity in Myanmar, with cumulative fish loss and reduction of capture fisheries.Fisheries are the fifth largest earner of foreign exchange and fish is also a major part of the diet inMyanmar."}, {"text_block_id": "p246_b7", "text": "172.

The existing (and underconstruction / development) capacity for gas based power will be about 1 700 MW withina few years, which will consume over 300 MMCFD when simultaneously in operation. Asreserve capacity needs increase to 2030, and if gas would be used to meet this capacityneed, then total gas consumption could reach some 1 000 MMCFD. This requirement forgas may not be able to be met through a future domestic gas quota but could instead bemet by imported LNG or by light fuel oils. However, the cost of LNG exceeds 18 $/MMBtuwhereas the subsidised price to the current gas fired plants in Myanmar is around 7.5$/MMBtu for domestic consumers and 11-12 $/MMBtu for industry. This cost differencemeans that LNG would be a very expensive solution for the country (whether LNG is usedby the power subsector or by industry). Therefore it is clear that it is preferable to use lightfuel oils to fuel reserve capacity plant. LNG imports can be considered again nearer to thetime when the current gas supply contracts expire, if it is feasible to negotiate for a higherquota of domestic consumption.

The EMP is based on hourly economic dispatch, allowing for detailed modelling to 288 timeperiods. This level of granularity is important to capture the variable characteristics of the generationprofiles of seasonal hydropower and intermittent renewable energy. A key planning criterion forelectricity expansion planning is related to the security of the electricity system. Security is determinedby the reserve capacity (spinning reserve or standby). Up until the 1990’s reserve capacity was mostlyset on a deterministic basis as a % of installed capacity. Economists were dissatisfied with thisapproach as the spare capacity could not be valued economic terms. With the advent of advancedcomputer tools, it became feasible to compute the Loss of Load Probability (LOLP). The associatedExpected Unserved Energy could then be valued in strict economic terms and compared to the cost tofind the trade-off point between security and cost. However, the LOLP approach is problematic in ahydro-dominated system where the impact of water limitations can far outweigh power plant unitfailures.

As a result, a considerable amount of varietal degeneration was found in allareas of rice cultivation surveyed, likely the result of farmers using seeds from their own harvest forextended time periods”. Furthermore, Naing/Kingsbury recommended that “The seed productionsector should be strengthened to supply quality seeds at affordable prices to farmers throughout thecountry. In addition, farmers should be trained to carefully select and manage their own seedproduction fields”. While seed quality is not linked directly to energy use, nevertheless foodproduction will be affected and energy consumption will therefore be affected indirectly.

Therefore, from the economic analysis perspective, the value ofcoal, whether locally produced or imported can be chosen for the study by taking reference frominternational coal markets applicable to Myanmar."}, {"text_block_id": "p142_b20", "text": "Sources: MOE, MPPE, CSO 2014"}, {"text_block_id": "p141_b20", "text": "Sources: MOE, MPPE, CSO 2014"}, {"text_block_id": "p138_b20", "text": "'000"}, {"text_block_id": "p137_b20", "text": "500"}, {"text_block_id": "p136_b20", "text": "Kerosene (Other)Gasoline / diesel oil Fuel oilWhite spiritLubricants"}, {"text_block_id": "p135_b20", "text": "LPGNapthaMotor gasolineAviation gasolineKerosene (Jet Fuel)"}, {"text_block_id": "p133_b20", "text": "30,000"}, {"text_block_id": "p132_b20", "text": "-"}, {"text_block_id": "p129_b20", "text": "23-39-6-13"}, {"text_block_id": "p127_b20", "text": "Steel2189112420261519273"}, {"text_block_id": "p124_b20", "text": "150"}, {"text_block_id": "p123_b20", "text": "2009-10128272020751"}, {"text_block_id": "p121_b20", "text": "Mahu TaungKaniSagaing0.80 Lignite"}, {"text_block_id": "p119_b20", "text": "Source: Ministry of Mining (MOM)"}, {"text_block_id": "p113_b20", "text": "800"}, {"text_block_id": "p112_b20", "text": "10%"}, {"text_block_id": "p111_b20", "text": "-"}, {"text_block_id": "p110_b20", "text": "10%"}, {"text_block_id": "p107_b20", "text": "-"}, {"text_block_id": "p184_b20", "text": "Paraffin wax‘000 ton0.960"}, {"text_block_id": "p181_b20", "text": "100"}, {"text_block_id": "p180_b20", "text": "6,000"}, {"text_block_id": "p174_b20", "text": "100"}, {"text_block_id": "p173_b20", "text": "2,000"}, {"text_block_id": "p170_b20", "text": "300"}, {"text_block_id": "p168_b20", "text": "600"}, {"text_block_id": "p166_b20", "text": "4,000"}, {"text_block_id": "p165_b20", "text": "Sources: MOE, MOGE, Consultant’s analysis"}, {"text_block_id": "p161_b20", "text": "400"}, {"text_block_id": "p158_b20", "text": "40,000"}, {"text_block_id": "p156_b20", "text": "-"}, {"text_block_id": "p154_b20", "text": "Shwe8.7%"}, {"text_block_id": "p153_b20", "text": "PRC"}, {"text_block_id": "p151_b20", "text": "PYAY0.17%"}, {"text_block_id": "p148_b20", "text": "White Spirit SBP-33363331222530373729243325"}, {"text_block_id": "p147_b20", "text": "Other Products-----------18--"}, {"text_block_id": "p146_b20", "text": "White Spirit SBP-35373532232631393930253426"}, {"text_block_id": "p6_b20", "text": "II.ENERGY PLANNING"}, {"text_block_id": "p5_b20", "text": "ANNEXES"}, {"text_block_id": "p4_b20", "text": "C.Oil Consumption"}, {"text_block_id": "p3_b20", "text": "O.Primary Oil"}, {"text_block_id": "p2_b20", "text": "J.Introduction"}, {"text_block_id": "p60_b20", "text": "Source: IMF"}, {"text_block_id": "p59_b20", "text": "50 - 100"}, {"text_block_id": "p48_b20", "text": "Terajoule"}, {"text_block_id": "p43_b20", "text": "IEP Team"}, {"text_block_id": "p40_b20", "text": "Population 7 (millions)61.063.565.467.469.471.573.7"}, {"text_block_id": "p39_b20", "text": "Net Imports-11.9-13.9-13.5-10.6-9.0-6.3-5.2"}, {"text_block_id": "p35_b20", "text": "in consumer's premises"}, {"text_block_id": "p34_b20", "text": "Table E13: Electricity Demand & Transformation Losses"}, {"text_block_id": "p28_b20", "text": "Coal0.10.10.20.20.30.40.6"}, {"text_block_id": "p347_b20", "text": "40Soft Drink (Ve Ve)Green Circle Co;
