It also created a labelling system to identify energy efficient buildings and introduces measures to discourage air-conditioned buildings in France. Calculations now include natural lighting and renewable energy sources. RT 2012 strengthens the existing requirements (and lays down the following main requirements:</div><ul><li>Minimum energy efficiency requirement for the 'bioclimatic need' - 'Biomax' of the building (isolation, efficiency of heating and lighting systems)</li><li>Maximum average primary energy consumption of the building below 50 kWh/mÂ²/year - 'Cmax'</li><li>Summer comfort requirement (maximum interior temperature for 5 consecutive summer days) to encourage bioclimatic architecture</li></ul><div>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;Additional requirements and guidelines are set for: the general building quality, living comfort, preference for renewable energies, good energy use of the building, potential for energy production beyond self-sufficient production.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;Overall, the RT 2012 aims at reducing the primary energy consumption in buildings by 150bn kWh between 2013 and 2020 and reducing the CO2 emissions by 13m-35m tonnes of CO2 (depending on the method) between 2013 and 2020."}
