The plan targets energy storage, electricity generation in transport, gas networks and CO2 storage.\n\nThe Plan is organised on three main actions to focus on: 1) Production of hydrogen by electrolysis for industry, phase of initiation, 2) A valorization by uses of the mobility in complementarity of the batteries, and 3) ensuring the stabilization of energy networks in the medium-long term. Ten specific measures and objectives are subsequently defined."}
