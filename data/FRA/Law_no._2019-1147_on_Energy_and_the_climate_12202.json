The law notably enshrines into law the objective of carbon neutrality for 2050 and sets a number of quantified objectives for the energy sector. It is an extensive document amending the Energy Code, the Environment Code, the General code of local and regional authorities and other codes and laws. The law notably makes the High Council for the climate a permanent body (art. 11 and 12), enacts the closure of the last four French coal power plants (art. 12), streamlines the administrative framework of electricity supply companies with the aim of boosting renewables (art 14), takes measures to improve energy efficiency in building, discusses measures to regulate air and maritime international transport. It amends several pieces of legislation to increase the emphasis on adaptation to climate change and resilience, alongside mitigation efforts. Article 1 further aims to promote a research and innovation policy that favours the adaptation of business sectors to the energy transition."}
