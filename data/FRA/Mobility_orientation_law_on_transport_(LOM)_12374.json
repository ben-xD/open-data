It has four objectives: 1) Get out of car addiction, 2) Accelerate the growth of new transport modes, 3) achieve the ecological transition, and 4) Schedule investments in transport infrastructure.<br><br>The objective of carbon neutrality for land transport by 2050 is enshrined into law. This objective is accompanied by a ban on sales of fossil-fueled cars (petrol or diesel) by 2040. A bicycle plan is being implemented, with the aim of tripling the modal share of the bicycle by 2024. A bicycle fund is created to fight against breaks in cycle paths, to generalize the marking of bikes against theft, etc.<br><br>The text also promotes the deployment of electric vehicles and sets the objective of increasing public charging stations by five by 2022.<br><br>A sustainable mobility package (to replace the bicycle kilometric allowance) is introduced. It allows employers to pay up to 400 euros per year to employees commuting to work by bicycle or carpooling. The State will generalize this package to its agents in 2020, up to 200 euros per year.<br><br>Voluntary local authorities can deploy low emission zones (ZFE). Access to these areas is reserved for the least polluting vehicles and is based on the Crit'air sticker system. Local authorities can define the terms of access to these areas: geographic perimeter, vehicles concerned, hourly and daily terms."}
