ELPA actualises legal dispositions to electricity supply, distribution and demand while promoting renewable energy and ensuring security of supply.\n\nThe new act liberalises the power sector, as independent power producers are allowed to supply the country alongside the Barbados Light and Power Company under a licensing scheme. Interconnection is promoted.\n\nELPA charges the Minister to determine minimum and maximum supply targets. These governmental targets are not included in the act itself. They include an objective of renewable energy share of primary energy to be above 30% by 2020.\n\nThe Electricity Light and (Amendment) Act, 2015 is the current version in force."}
