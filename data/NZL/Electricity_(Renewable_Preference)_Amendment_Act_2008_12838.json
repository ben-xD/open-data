this Amendment Act is 'to reduce the impact of fossil-fuelled thermal electricity generation on climate change by creating a preference for renewable electricity generation through the implementation of a 10-year restriction on new baseload fossil-fuelled thermal electricity generation capacity, except where an exemption is appropriate (for example, to ensure security of supply).' The Act also specifies how exemptions to the provisions of the Act may be granted by the Minister of Energy (e.g. in an emergency or if the plant in question operates in a way that reduces GHG emissions by certain percentages.<br />\n<br />\nThis Act repealed the Electricity Amendment Act 2001, which specifies that both the Minister in charge of electricity and the Electricity Governance Board (established under the Act) must, before making any recommendations as regards electricity governance regulations, have regard to ensuring consistency with the government's climate change policies and objectives."}
