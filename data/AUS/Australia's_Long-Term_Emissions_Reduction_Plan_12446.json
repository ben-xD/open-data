The plan is based on five key principles:1. Technology not taxes – no new costs for households or businesses,2. Expand choices, not mandates – we will work to expand consumer choice, both domestically and with our trading partners,3. Drive down the cost of a range of new energy technologies – bringing a portfolio of technologies to parity is the objective of Australia’s Technology Investment Roadmap,4. Keep energy prices down with affordable and reliable power – our Plan will consolidate our advantage in affordable and reliable energy, protecting the competitiveness of our industries and the jobs they support, and5. Be accountable for progress – transparency is essential to converting ambition into achievement. Australia will continue to set ambitious yet achievable whole- of-economy goals, then beat them, consistent with our approach to our Kyoto- era and Paris Agreement targets.The plan states that the \"wellbeing and prosperity of Australia’s regional communities at its core. It will not impose new costs on households, businesses or the broader economy. Our actions under the Plan will not lead to job losses or place burdens onto regional communities.\"The plan contains four chapters focused on: Driving down the costs of low emissions technologies, Enabling deployment at scale, Seizing opportunities in new and traditional markets, and Fostering global collaboration. It makes reference to a number of other key policy documents, including the Technology Investment Roadmap."}
