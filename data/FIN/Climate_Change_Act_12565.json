To build a low carbon society, the act proposes to reduce Finland's emissions by 80% of the 1990 levels by 2050. The law exempts EU ETS from its remit. It aims to increase the efficiency of the public sector to improve smart 'societal planning' while retaining the competitiveness of the economy in achieving the targets without imposing new obligations on businesses or others. The act includes a planning and monitoring system and measures to clarify the climate policy planning of state authorities. This Act provides for medium and long term plans. The long term plans include the alternatives for reaching the long term emissions target and needs approval every 10 years, while the medium term plans concern measures outside the emissions trading scheme (traffic, housing, agriculture) and are to be approved once per election term and the respective government is required to report to the parliament on the implementation. The plan for adaptation stipulates a risk and vulnerability review and to be approved once every 10 years. Further the Act also provides provision for the constitution of a multidisciplinary expert body to support planning of climate policy."}
