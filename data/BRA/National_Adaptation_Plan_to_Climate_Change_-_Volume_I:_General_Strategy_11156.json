The Plan was drawn up by the Executive Group of the Inter-ministerial Committee on Climate Change between 2013 and 2016, as provided for in the National Policy for Climate Change (PNMC - Law 12.187/09) and its enabling decree (Decree 7.390/10). It was drawn up in consonance with the National Plan for Climate Change, with sectoral mitigation and adaptation plans, and with decisions on adaptation undertaken by Brazil within the framework of the Conference of the Parties (COP) on Climate Change.\n\nThis Plan proposes actions, strategies and guidelines for management and reduction of climate risk in Brazil, with a view to facing up to the adverse effects of the social, economic and environmental dimensions of climate change. It also proposes institutional mechanisms for concerted deployment among states and municipalities, economic sectors and the general public, and for scheduled implementation of structural measures to overcome gaps observed in the national context. It has two volumes: Volume I “General Strategy “ features and details structural components of the plan: its legal framework, objectives, goals and governance and Volume ll “Sectoral and Thematic Strategies\".\n\n\n\nThe second volume presents adaptation strategies for the following sectors: Agriculture, Biodiversity and Ecosystems, Cities, Disaster Risk Management, Industry and Mining, Infrastructure, Vulnerable populations, water resources, health, food and nutritional security, and strategy for coastal zones.\n\nThe main objective of the document is to present guidelines for adaptation to climate change for each sector, based on the premise that the inability of a given sector to fully exercise its normal activities because of the impacts of climate change, might directly or indirectly influence the functional stability of other sectors.\n\nFor each sector it presents a brief analysis of the main vulnerabilities, presents guidelines for adaptation measures and the interdependence of each sector with other sectors."}
