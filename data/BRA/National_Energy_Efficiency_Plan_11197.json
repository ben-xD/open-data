It presents the existing regulatory framework and instruments and actions in a number of economic sectors and areas. It also makes suggestions for improvement and further actions in each area; these include: studies, incentive mechanisms, capacity-building, financing, regulation, improved management, and better co-ordination and integration amongst the different existing programmes. The plan also seeks to clarify responsibilities for the different stakeholder institutions.<br />\n<br />\nThe areas covered by the PNEf are: electricity, industry and micro, small, and medium enterprises, transport, education, buildings, public lighting, sanitation, solar heating, research and development, monitoring and verification, international partnerships, and financing. The national programmes on electricity conservation, rational use of oil and natural gas derivatives, and energy efficiency labelling are also evaluated."}
