The plan focuses on three dimensions: value chain, mineral goods and organizational and operational limitations. It doesn't take into account the chemical processing of minerals and external transport, which it states should be considered on the Industry and Transports Plans. It presents the sector's current emissions, its potential for the reduction of emissions, possible obstacles for implementation, adaptation recommendations, financing needs and sources, and monitoring. Its main focus is mitigation."}
