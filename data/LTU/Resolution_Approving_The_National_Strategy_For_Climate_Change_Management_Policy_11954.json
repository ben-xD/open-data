The greatest potential for final energy savings in the transport sector is 44% of the overall potential of final energy savings in the LP case and 41% in the HP case. In industry, the potential amounts to 27% and 20% respectively, while in the case of households it accordingly equals 15% and 24%. The biggest fuel savings potential for heating by households in 2020 is 44% in the LP case and 56% in the HP case. The biggest electricity savings potential in industry is 54% in the LP case and 55% in the HP case.

As part of the EU-wide considerations of the possible impact of climate change on regions, the aggregate potential impact on the territory of Lithuania was assessed as “none or marginal”, while in the case of Vilnius County it was distinguished as “low level negative”. Lithuania has also been assessed in terms of its possible vulnerability to climate change. Similarly, impact and possible vulnerability to climate change is also expected in the case of a number of territories of the Baltic Sea countries. However, Western European countries, especially the Netherlands, Spain, Italy and Ireland are expected to be exposed to the average or even highest negative impact. In terms of its capacity to adapt to the impact of climate change, Lithuania, as, for instance, Latvia, Estonia, Austria or Hungary, has been evaluated as having low capacity to adapt to such impact.
