These data were used as a reference point for the estimation of total growth and itsstructure (main use, intermediate use, dead tree volume and volume change) in 2018–2040. Gross standgrowth for the years 2007 to 2017 is estimated on the basis of NFI data and is projected as the product ofthe area forecast for the tree species concerned and the average annual volume increment over the period2018–2040. The annual stand volume growth is slightly decreasing due to their ageing. The projected overallgrowth remains fairly stable, averaging between 20.51 and 20.04 million m 3 per year. The decreasing treevolume growth primarily owes to changes in the structure of the tree age classes: recently, the middle-agedstands occupying the largest areas and generating the largest volume and carbon accumulation have beenageing, which leads to increasing areas of older and more mature stands with lower volume growth andGHG uptake. Based to the current level of use and regeneration of pine forests, the largest reduction in thevolume growth of these stands is anticipated. Reductions in growth are also projected due to the large areaof mature stands and the small area of juvenile stands, as both the ageing stands and juvenile stands havea lower growth rate than the most productive middle-aged stands. The projected increase in the volume offelling relates both to the increase in the volume of main fellings in mature stands due to the projectedincrease in the area of mature trees and to the increase in the volume of intermediate felling, in particularthinning, in order to increase forest sustainability and reduce tree deaths and forest losses. The main forestuse in forests has been estimated as the product of the equivalent area of mature stands to be felled andthe average volume of mature stands. An equivalent area of mature stands to be felled each year wascalculated on the basis of the age class distribution of each tree species and the use of mature stands overa period of 12 to 15 years. It is estimated that the increase in the volume of main fellings in 2018–2027 willbe affected by the restoration of economic activity in roughly 200 000 hectares of forest allocated forproperty restoration, either by designating these forests as public forests or by restoring private property.In order to reduce the volume of dying trees and consequently the forest cultivation losses, a gradualincrease in the use of intermediate forests is forecast. Intermediate forest use is projected to account for40-50% of basic forest use, drawing on many years of experience. In view of the increase in primary andintermediate forest use, general forest use is bound to increase in all forests of the country from10.11 million m 3 in 2017 to 11.75 million m 3 in 2040 (Table 4.2.1.4). Thus, due to the projected increase inthe volume of stand intermediate fellings, smaller natural losses of trees are anticipated. According to theNFI data, the average annual share of dead trees in the total volume increase decreased from 21% to 18%over the period 2007-2017. Taking into account the anticipated higher intensity of thinning, a correspondingdecrease in the volume of dead trees is forecast.
