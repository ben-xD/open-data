Fossil fuels are subject to specific excise duties on the basis of weight or volume units. Biofuels are incentivised through a reduction of this excise duty. In particular, the Budget Law 2010 defines a maximum of 18,000 tonnes of biofuels that can benefit from this reduction. Italian legislation also stipulates that fossil fuel producers should annually supply a minimum quota of biofuels based on the total amount of fuel supplied during the previous year.\n\nArticle 1 of <a href=\"https://www.gazzettaufficiale.it/eli/id/2018/12/31/18G00172/sg\">Law No. 145/2018</a> continued tax rebates on energy-efficient buildings renovations until the end of 2019, and strengthened the financial support for biogas plants generating electricity under 300 kW."}
