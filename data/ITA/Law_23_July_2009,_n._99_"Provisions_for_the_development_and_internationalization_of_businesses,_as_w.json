First, the incentive period is raised to 15 years. Second, the number of certificates issued varies depending on the type of renewable source, according to a coefficient of multiplicative energy produced.\n\nEnergy - demand-side policies: the 2008 Budget Law includes new measures relating to the production of electricity from renewable energy sources. In particular, it allows small renewable plants (<1 MW and < 200 kW for wind plants) commissioned after 1 January 2008 to choose between green certificates and a feed-in tariff mechanism (called 'all inclusive tariff') for an incentive period of 15 years. Both green certificates and all-inclusive tariffs are differentiated by renewable energy source."}
