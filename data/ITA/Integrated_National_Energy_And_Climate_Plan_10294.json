The regasification capacity, together with the small scale, will therefore constitute a fundamental factor for Italy as it makes the transition to a completely carbon-free system, since it will make it possible to seize on the opportunities presented by an LNG market that is expected to be in oversupply, probably by the middle of the next decade, and at the same time manage the reduction of imports from southern countries (in particular from Algeria), thus offering supply alternatives for the spot market. In order to increase security, diversification and competition for the Italian gas system, the development of new LNG import capacity may constitute the factor necessary for guaranteeing the presence of more spot supply sources able to compete for the position of marginal source, keeping in line with European prices. In the gas sector various projects for small-scale LNG (SSLNG) coastal storage terminals have already been submitted to the authorities responsible for issuing construction and operating permits (the Ministry of Economic Development and the Ministry of Infrastructure and Transport), to be carried out in Sardinia and on the Adriatic coast (Ravenna and Porto Marghera) and in the Tyrrhenian sea (Naples), for unloading LNG from small methane carriers, storing it and then loading it onto bunker barges and cryogenic tankers in order to refuel civilian and/or industrial customers and supply LNG to fuel stations. In Sardinia two of the three initiatives put forward envisage the coupling of SSLNG and mini regasification units. It will be appropriate and cost-effective to (i) provide natural gas to Sardinian industrial undertakings, citizen distribution networks, whether existing (replacing the current propane gas network) and already compatible with natural gas or under construction; (ii) to replace the fuels used by heavy-duty vehicles; (iii) to replace conventional marine fuels with LNG by gradually introducing a limit of 0.1 % of sulphur content in fuels used by ships at berth in ports and passenger vessels, and (iv) to"}, {"text_block_id": "p142_b1215", "text": "Work will also be carried out on development of the net metering mechanism (which enables the use of the network as a storage system), to promote rewards for plants on the basis of their quota of self-consumed energy, which can also be increased by installing accumulation systems, and for plants which go on to provide services to ensure the safety of the electricity system on medium-and low-voltage networks."}, {"text_block_id": "p142_b1216", "text": "In all cases, promotion of individual self-consumption will be aimed primarily at distribution plants for which, moreover, the simplicity and automated nature of the support mechanisms make them preferable to other tools which are more complex and expensive to manage."}, {"text_block_id": "p142_b1217", "text": "Further instruments to support self-consumption, both individual and collective, will be:"}, {"text_block_id": "p142_b1218", "text": "−"}, {"text_block_id": "p142_b1219", "text": "reinforcing minimum quota obligations for renewable energy sources in new buildings or buildings subject to major renovation, in line with the targets for near-zero emissions buildings;"}, {"text_block_id": "p213_b1220", "text": "supply natural gas to the thermoelectric power plants put in place for the phase-out of carbon fuelled plants.

To offer Sardinian users connected to the distribution network prices in line with the rest of Italy, technical/regulatory solutions will need to be adopted which allow system charges to be levelled and the price of raw material to be correlated to the virtual trading point (VTP). To this end, in order to guarantee Sardinian consumers the requisite level of safety, parity and continuity of supply, consideration will be given to the possibility of connecting coastal storage units being built and authorised and regasification terminals in operation in Italy that will be equipped with a reloading system managed by the TSO, and to adopting a system that correlates the price of raw material to the VTP. In that regard, it should be noted that new projects are under way, including the OLT Offshore LNG regasification terminal in Tuscany that will make it possible to provide, in addition to the other activities it currently carries out, a small-scale service for unloading GNL onto small boats that will refurnish coastal storage facilities and bunkers in Italian ports and ports throughout the Mediterranean, as well as an identical service for the NGL plant in Panigaglia.
