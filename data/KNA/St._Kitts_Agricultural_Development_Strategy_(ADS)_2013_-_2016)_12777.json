framework to improve the production and marketing of national agricultural products over the period 2013 to 2016. The document acknowledges the criticality of climate change and resource scarcity and the subsequent need to adopt a sustainable agriculture agenda.<br />\n<br />\nThe Strategy first states the national agriculture situation, then develops a vision and development goals, establishes the Planning for Implementation Network, and details the Institutional Development Plan. Development goals include: 1) to provide safe, affordable food and nutrition security, 2) to create sustainable resilient farming systems in oder to support effective land, water and biodiversity management, and 3) to create resilient farming systems capable of adapting to hazards of a changing climate. The Core Program on Agricultural Risk Management and Climate Change Adaptation shall be activated to reach this latter goal."}
