The Policy emphasises affordable, clean renewables as a key target, but also a greener, energy savvy transportation sector.<br />\n<br />\nThe government seeks to green the country's power supply through 1) increased diversification, with greater reliance on indigenous energy sources, 2) the promotion of smarter, efficient approaches, 3) decentralised generation and interconnection systems between the country's two main islands, and 4) increased research and development of renewable energy resources and conservation measures. Energy efficiency and conservation are also promoted to minimise energy intensity. Public-private partnerships, transparent, inclusive and informed policy making in an adequately framed energy sector are key elements highlighted by the policy to achieve the country's sustainable energy targets. Such an institutional framework encompasses the collection, monitoring and reporting of carbon emissions stemming from the electricity sector. New building codes and mandatory installation of solar thermal collectors for major water users shall also be implemented.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />"}
