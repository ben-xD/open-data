This law further adopts the Swedish National Climate Strategy into law. The National Climate Strategy concerns municipal land and water use, municipal development and preservation of the built environment, how municipalities intend to meet national climate targets and comply with environmental quality standards, how municipalities aim to consider the plan with respect to other national and regional objectives, how municipalities intend to accommodate long-term housing needs, and how municipalities will consider rural development in coastal zones."}
