This regulation forms the basis of grants for all types of solar/PV installations. The solar/PV market in Sweden is predominantly focused on off-grid installations in homes in remote areas and utilities such as communication stations or lighthouses. Grid-connected facilities with solar/PV are mostly used for research or demonstration purposes. The regulation is aimed at private individuals, companies and municipalities.<br />\n<br />\nIn November 2011 the regulation was amended, which reduced the subsidies from 46% to a maximum of 43% of the eligible costs per installation from 1 February 2013 onwards. The total budget allocated to the 2013-2016 period is SEK210m (USD28.4m)."}
