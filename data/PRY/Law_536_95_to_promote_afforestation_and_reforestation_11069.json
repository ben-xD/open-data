The priority areas are exempt from other legal obligations, such as the Agrarian Reform.\n\nThe document details the specific rules associated to priority areas. To incentivise growing forestry, the State will apply a one-time cost rebate by 75% for each afforested or reforested area. These concerns the direct costs of implantation and management costs (art. 7)."}
