It notably creates the National System of the Environment (SISNAM), integrated by the set of organs and public entities of the national, departmental and municipal governments, with environmental competence; and private entities created with the same purpose. The system also aims at avoiding institutional conflicts, gaps or competition overlaps. The System's supervisory attributions include climate-related matters."}
