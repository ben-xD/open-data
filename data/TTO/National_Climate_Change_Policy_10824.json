World Meteorological Organization (WMO), the Earth has warmed on average by 0.74 °C (degrees Celsius) over the last hundred years, with 0.4 °C of this warming occurring since 1970. The past decade has been the warmest on record since the beginning of instrumental climate records in 1850. Globally, the rate of warming averaged over the last 50 years is nearly twice that of the last 100 years. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has determined that 90 % of the warming effect can be attributed to human activities since the onset of the industrial revolution such as burning of fossil fuels for power generation, transport, industrial processes and housing. Since 1979, anthropogenic induced global warming and climate change has been recognised as an environmental problem affecting mankind and recently acknowledged as perhaps the most pressing environmental issue of the twenty first century which can pose significant challenges to sustainable development objectives."}, {"text_block_id": "p5_b45_merged", "text": "The international policy response to global climate change has been through the adoption of two legal instruments: the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and its Kyoto Protocol. Trinidad and Tobago is a ratified signatory to both these legal instruments. The ultimate objective of the UNFCCC is “the stabilisation of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that will prevent dangerous human interference with the climate system and in a timeframe that would allow ecosystems to adapt naturally, will not hamper food production and allow sustainable economic development.” The Kyoto Protocol is a legally binding instrument that requires developed country parties to reduce their aggregate greenhouse gas emissions by 5.2 % below their 1990 levels by 2012. Developing countries parties have no such legally binding commitment. However, being signatories to the UNFCCC, they are mandated to pursue development pathways that will achieve the ultimate objective of the UNFCCC by following a low carbon paradigm as far as possible."}, {"text_block_id": "p5_b51", "text": "1.1.1 Science and Impacts of Climate Change"}, {"text_block_id": "p5_b52", "text": "While global warming and climate change is not a new phenomenon and has been occurring naturally for millions of years, there is now mounting evidence that there is currently an accelerated rate of warming and climate change as a result of human activity, primarily due to an increase in the concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere as a result of fossil fuel combustion, industrial processes and waste management. Emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs), which are attributed to be the cause of global warming and associated climate change, continue to rise.
