It promotes human development, equality, democratic participation, sovereignty and self reliance, and a sustainable use of natural resources.\n\nClimate change mitigation and adaptation are to be pursued, notably by strategies targeting the extractive and energy sectors. The integration of carbon sinks in the country's negotiation assets, a national greenhouse gas emissions tax and permits incentive are discussed. The Plan further calls for fostering climate change research to improve mitigation and adaptation efforts."}
