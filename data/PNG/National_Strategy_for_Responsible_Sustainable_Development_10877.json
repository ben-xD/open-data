It aims to enable a responsible management and use of our natural resources and reach climate change resilience, thus sustainably protecting forests, fisheries, agricultural and water resources. Instruments discussed in the strategy includes carbon credits and energy efficiency, notably in the transport system.\n\nThe strategy seeks more generally to shift the paradigm of development towards clean energy and zero-carbon, inclusive growth. A national green growth plan should be developed to create enabling conditions, find streaming mechanisms to ensure opportunities are explored through existing economic activities, and design policy instruments to tap specific opportunities within spatial and resource systems."}
