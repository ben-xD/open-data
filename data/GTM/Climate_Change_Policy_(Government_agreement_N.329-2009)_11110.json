It aims to develop climate change national capacities; promote vulnerability reduction and improvements in adaptation to climate change; and mitigate GHG emissions. The policy was detailed in 2016 with the National Action Plan for Climate Change. To achieve these goals, the policy proposes measures to increase public awareness and technology and knowledge transfer, improving risk management and adopting adaptation measures. GHG emissions are addressed under a broad and comprehensive approach that suggests actions related to forest and waste management, energy production and consumption, financial mechanisms, and carbon market."}
