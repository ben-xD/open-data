The law also delegates responsibility to the various governmental agencies to develop and implement climate change policies within specific areas that will ultimately address: carbon emissions generated by land use and the energy sector; the creation of a carbon market; increasing public awareness and participation; public financing; and development of climate-related policies.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;It further establishes the national climate change information system and the national climate change fund to finance projects that address risk management, adaptation and/or mitigation (with 80% of the fund dedicated to risk and vulnerability management and adaptation). The law finally asks the government to adopt regulation of carbon emissions from public and private activities in the transportation sector. It also evokes the creation of a national energy plan that focuses on the development of renewable energy."}
