driving institutional development to improve energy efficiency, specifically mandating the creation of: the National Energy Efficiency and Conservation Authority (NEECA, transformed from former National Energy Conservation Centre - ENERCON); the Authority Fund; and the National Energy Efficiency and Conservation Board.<br />\nNEECA's functions include among others (Article 7):<br />\n<ul><br />\n<li>serve as sole focal Federal authority for initiating, catalyzing, carrying out and coordinating the implementation of all energy conservation programs in all sectors of economy;</li><br />\n<li>administer, implement and enforce the provisions of the Act and the rules and regulations made thereunder;</li><br />\n<li>prepare or update national energy conservation policy for the approval of the Board;</li><br />\n<li>carry out energy audits;</li><br />\n<li>initiate demonstration and research programmes (...).</li><br />\n</ul><br />\nThe National Energy Efficiency and Conservation Board is an inter ministerial body, including among its members for example Federal Secretaries of Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Planning and Development, Ministry of Housing and others. The Board is responsible for the supervision, management of the affairs, and policy direction of the NEECA. Its main functions include promotion of energy conservation and efficient development of energy efficient technologies, certification of energy efficient products and projects.<br />\nThe Act further defines \"Powers and functions of the Federal Government to facilitate and enforce efficient use of energy and its conservation\" (Article 10-13), including powers to prescribe energy conservation building codes, issue energy saving certificates, prescribe the value of energy and establish an Energy Conservation Fund for the purposes of promotion of efficient use of energy and its conservation within its territory."}
