A radical shift in the electricity mix due to the planned gradual phase-out of nuclear power by 2025 is planned; 4) the internal energy market dimension : regarding energy transport infrastructure, efforts will be made in the coming years to strengthen the existing interconnections with France and the Netherlands; 5) research, Innovation and Competitiveness dimension : Belgium is committed to devoting at least 3% of its gross domestic product overall to R&D."}
