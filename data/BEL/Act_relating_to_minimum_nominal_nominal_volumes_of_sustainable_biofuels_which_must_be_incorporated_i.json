The quota obligation applies to all registered oil companies offering petrol or diesel products for consumption. The providers of petrol E5 or E10 or diesel fuels have to ensure that biofuels make up a certain volume (see below) of the company's total annual sale of fuel by the end of each calendar year. The following volumes apply: E5: 4% v/v, E10: 9% v/v, and Diesel: 6% v/v. If a provider fails to fulfil the quota, they must pay a fine of EUR900 (USD1,129) per 1,000 litres of biofuels that was not blended with the annual amount of petrol or diesel products sold."}
