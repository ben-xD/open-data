resolutions:</div><ul><li>National Plan for Reducing Global Dependence on Oil for Transportation - Government Resolution 2790 (February 2010)</li><li>Establishing a national effort to develop technologies for reducing global use of oil in transportation and reinforcement of high-tech industries in the sphere - Government Resolution 1354 (January 2011)</li></ul><div>&nbsp;It aims to reduce the proportion of petroleum-based fuels in transportation between 2013 and 2025, to about 30% by 2020, and approximately 60% by 2025, in relation to the forecasted consumption for those years, as long as the transition is economically viable - by simplifying regulatory processes, establishing new regulations and policies, and accelerated regulatory incentives and support for technological demonstrations and field tests for alternative fuels.<br>&nbsp;The resolution lays out a governmental action plan, including, among others -</div><ul><li>Promoting CNG buses</li><li>Completing standardisation of fuel alternatives</li><li>Formulating, in co-operation with the Budget Department of the Ministry of Finance and the Tax Authority, an outline for regulation and policies for the new forms of transportation that reduce use of private transportation in cities and at their entry-points</li><li>Examining methods to increase competitiveness in fuel market</li><li>Instructing the Tax Authority to examine adapting green taxation policy in order to integrate flex fuel vehicles in Israel</li><li>Advancing field trials and pilot projects to demonstrate and prove the economic and operational feasibility of petroleum alternatives in transportation in Israel. This has been budgeted with ILS60 million (USD15.6 million) by 2018</li><li>Establishing an inter-ministerial team, headed by the Director of the National Plan for Petroleum Alternatives, to formulate a comprehensive policy to encourage introducing petroleum substitute-based transportation into cities, including the necessary infrastructure; the director of the National Plan for Petroleum Alternatives will present progress biannually to the government</li></ul>"}
