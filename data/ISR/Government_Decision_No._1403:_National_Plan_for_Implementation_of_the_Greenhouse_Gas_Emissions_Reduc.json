Cabinet issued decision n. 1403 on April 10, 2016 which officialises the National Plan for Implementation of the Greenhouse Gas Emissions Reduction Targets and for Energy Efficiency. The decision exposes the numerous emissions reductions and energy efficiency targets laid out in a <a href=\"http://www.sviva.gov.il/English/env_topics/climatechange/NatlEmissionsReductionPlan/Pages/default.aspx\">process</a> that originated in Government decision n. 542 of September 2015 and how those targets shall be attained. It also names institutions that shall pursue the analytical and managerial tasks needed to finance the transition, amend laws and take other measures to reach the overall emissions and efficiency targets.<br>&nbsp;<br> The Plan gives directions to reducing electricity consumption via setting up an advisory team to the Finance Minister and the Accountant General to consult on the objective of granting NIS 500 million over ten years for investment loans in energy efficiency and greenhouse gases emissions reductions. The grants program in energy efficiency will be operated by the Investment Centre and the National Authority for Technology and Innovation. The decision stipulates that grants will be awarded on a competitive basis over the economic performance of emissions reduction per unit of electricity saved. The Ministry of Finance alone shall allocate a budget of NIS 300 million.<br>&nbsp;<br> The decision tasks the Ministry of Energy to: 1) provide a multi-year plan for energy efficiency for 2030, 2) evaluate how to reduce electricity consumption, 3) amend the law accordingly to institute a mechanism for generating units of energy saved (Negawatts) in energy supply and demand, and to use electricity bills as a clearinghouse for repayment of loans, taking into consideration financial exposure of electricity providers. The decision also charges the Finance Minister in concentration with the Energy Minister to consider an update in tax policy regarding the deprecation for energy-saving products. Photovoltaic commercial facilities in particular will be granted a tax benefit in form of an accelerated depreciation at a 20 % rate over a three-year period.<br>&nbsp;<br> In terms of energy efficiency in buildings, the Plan urges the Energy Minister, the Environmental Protection Minister, the Construction and Housing Minister, and the Finance Minister to evaluate how to update the Energy Sources Law of 1989 to establish energy ratings for new residential buildings and offices based on Israeli Standard 5282. The Housing and Energy Ministers must explain how to achieve the emissions reduction target of of 5.9 M tCO2e by 2030 in the building sector, notably by 1) increase the number of new buildings built under the country's principal green building standard, SI 5281, and 2) assess technical means.<br>&nbsp;<br> Other measures in the Plan include a confirmation of the governmental efforts to achieve a 10 % target for electricity generation from renewables by 2020, in accordance with Government Decision 4450 of January 2009."}
