It details sectoral plans for wind, large-scale and household solar (photovoltaic, concentrated and water heater), hydro, geothermal and biomass (including waste-to-energy). For each resource, it assesses the potential, its financial and physical opportunities and provide a penetration target to 2020.  The Plan especially focuses on the objectives of a 12 per cent share of renewable resources in the energy mix by 2020, with 2.06% from wind, 4.2 per cent from solar, 3.24 per cent for hydro and 2.5 per cent for biomass. It furthers proposes a plan to develop the legal and legislative framework that would allow for the targets to be met, alongside the set up for a grid code, and several support policies including financial schemes (including net metering, feed-in tariffs, capital subsidy or rebate)."}
