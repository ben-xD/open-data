The Government of Grenada was of the view that the opportunity should be grasped to take a strategic approach to charting a course for the next phase of the country•s development.

While we note our achievements in these and other areas, we recognize that much more needs to be done both in the area of recovery and that of continued development.

However, the World economy is estimated to have experienced one of its strongest years of growth (5.1 per cent) in 2004, with the poorest countries showing signs of improvement (IMF, April 2005). An examination of underlying trends indicates a structural shift from agriculture towards services, with agriculture accounting for 27% of world economic activity in 1970, declining to 4% in 2001 and services increasing its share from 41% to 67% during the same period. The greater part of the shift has been observed in the developed countries, where agriculture•s share in economic activity, already relatively low, declined from 7% in 1970 to 2% and that of services increased from 58% to 72%. The corresponding figures in the case of developing countries as a group were a decrease in agriculture•s contribution to GDP from 27% to 11% and an increase in that of services from 41% to 52% (Shackman Liu and Xun, 2005). It should be noted, however, that the Caribbean services sectors, particularly in countries with large tourist industries, have exhibited a tendency to dominate economic activity, with rates ranging from 54% to 86% (Charles, 1994)."}, {"text_block_id": "p18_b435", "text": "Aggregated indicators have masked some of the difficulties experienced by the world•s leading economies over the last five to ten years.

The Asian financial and economic crisis, which is said to have resulted from a lack of transparency and efficiency in the banking system, cross-share-holdings between the firms and the banking system that artificially shielded companies from competitive forces, as well as over investment in the boom years, led to the closure of several financial institutions and a contraction of economic activity. Indonesia fared the worst, while Taiwan, Korea and Thailand were also affected. Given the trade and investment links with Japan, the problems also spread to the latter.

The fiscal situation, exacerbated by inadequate revenue collection and the economy•s narrow productive base, is also an important economic issue.
