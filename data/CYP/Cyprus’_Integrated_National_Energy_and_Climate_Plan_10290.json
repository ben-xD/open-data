However, the feasibility of these results has to be scrutinized thoroughly, as during low electricity demand and high PV output periods, a significant amount of curtailment may be observed. The results presented here estimate a curtailment level of 0.1% for solar PV and 0.5% for wind in 2030. Nonetheless, curtailment is not accurately captured by a long-term energy systems model as the one employed here.
