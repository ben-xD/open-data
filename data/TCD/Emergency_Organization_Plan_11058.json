The plan specifies two more specific objectives that stem from this: defining a permanent framework for organising and coordinating emergency relief and early recovery operations, and reducing the impact of disasters and building the resilience of Chad. The plan identifies multiple impacts of climate change as risk factors for Chad, including desertification, drought, and flooding. It states that the government will mainstream climate change adaptation into its disaster risk management planning, as well as specific measures to combat each risk factor during the different stages of disaster management, from preparedness to response to relief to recovery."}
