It primarily aims to increase the energy efficiency of the housing stock. This law targeted blocks of flats built between 1950-1990, individual housing units and social housing stock owned or managed by local councils. Local councils are mandated to draft local upgrading programmes for thermal rehabilitation or building envelopes and heating systems, installation of alternate systems of energy production from renewable sources. Funding for this is to be shared between the local and national budgets. The law was amended by 238/2013."}
