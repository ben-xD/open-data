The strategy notes that increasing energy efficiency is essential for Romania to meet its medium to long term climate change objectives of moving to a competitive low carbon economy by 2050. The Strategy was designed to align with the EU Energy Efficiency Directive (2012/27/EC).<br><br>The strategy plans to mobilise investment and technology for both energy efficiency measures and the introduction of onsite renewables generation. It is structured in three phases:<br><br>Phase I: Establishing foundations so that deep renovations can become a goal within 5 years<br>Phase II: Supporting technological development<br>Phase III: Deep renovation of Buildings within 15 years."}
