The Action Plan identifies the major policy directions and priorities to reduce GHG emission and adapt to climate change under national policy. This policy functions as the basis for implementation by all levels of governments and sectors.<br />\n<br />\nThe Action Plan starts with an analysis of trends and scenarios of climate change and anthropogenic GHG emissions. The gases subject to analysis are: carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide and perfluorocarbons. Impacts on water resources are regarded as the key concern in the face of climate change, due to glacier retreat, increase in evaporation and decrease in river flow due to temperature rise. Change in regional hydrological cycles is expected to have destructive impact on the scale and impact of natural disasters. Change in water quality is considered a significant threat to ecosystems, biodiversity and economy (e.g. irrigation). Vector-born and other dangerous diseases (including malaria), agricultural pests and diseases strong winds and sandstorms, heavy rainfalls, floods and mudflows, high temperature, extreme temperature variation and hot winds derived from climate change are expected to damage agriculture and public health.<br />\n<br />\nTo mitigate such climate change impacts, the proposed approaches are to reduce GHG emissions and to adapt to climate change. The measures to reduce GHGs (as a fulfilment of UNFCCC obligations) include: enhancement of energy efficiency in relevant sectors of the national economy; application of effective technologies and use of energy sources in the national economy (that promotes high economy growth rate and reduce or limit GHG emissions); protection and enhancement of natural sinks and reservoirs of GHGs; promotion of sustainable forest management practices, afforestation and reforestation; promotion of sustainable agriculture; development and research on renewable (and new) energies and environmentally sounds technologies for use; and encouragement of appropriate reforms in relevant sectors aimed at promoting policies and measures that reduce GHG emissions.<br />\n<br />\nPrinciples and direction of adaptation include: research on climate change and its impact on national resources, economy public health and development of additional adaptation measures; improvement of the systematic observation network and environmental monitoring to renew adaptation measures; improvement of systems to collect, analyze, interpret and disseminate data among end users; enhancement of weather forecasting, climate modelling and early warning systems to minimize the risk of natural disasters; capacity building to strengthen institutional, technical and human resources to promote adaptation in the fields of climate change and hydrological research, geographical information systems, environmental impact assessment, protection and re-cultivation of lands rational use of water resources, conservation of ecosystems, sustainable agriculture, infrastructure development and health protection; and implementation of actual projects on adaptation on priority areas related to rational use of natural resources, economy and health protection."}
