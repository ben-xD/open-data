Both exposure and vulnerability are compounded by other social and environmental trends, such as urbanization, environmental degradation, and the globalization of markets. Thus, to reduce both disaster and climate change risk, exposure needs to be minimized, vulnerability reduced, and capacities for resilience strengthened in ways that address both types of risk simultaneously, with neither approach compromising the other.
