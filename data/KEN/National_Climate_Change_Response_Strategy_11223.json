The Plan addresses eight action areas identified by the NCCRS, in addition to including a new subcomponent focusing on co-ordination. It defines clear measures on adaptation and mitigation to climate change across a wide range of issues, bringing an important contribution to the development of Kenya's legal and political framework in this realm. The 2013-2017 Climate Change Action Plan fits in the Kenya 2030 Vision, a long-term development plan adopted by the government in 2008. Implemented in successive five year plans, the 2030 vision is comprises three pillars (economic, social, and political). The 2013-2017 Climate Change Action Plan was replaced in May 2018 by the National Climate Change Action Plan 2018-2022."}
