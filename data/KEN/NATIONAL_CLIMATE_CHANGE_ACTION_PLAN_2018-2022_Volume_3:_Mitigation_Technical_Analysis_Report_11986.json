The current extent of tree cover on this agricultural land is not known, but at least, 10 percent tree cover on farms is targeted by the Agricultural (Farm Forestry) Rules 2009. Without additional information on the total area of land under agroforestry at the farm level, the proposed action aims to increase the total area under agroforestry at farm level by 200,000 acres by 2022. It is assumed that achieving 5% of additional tree cover on these lands using agroforestry practices is possible and a reasonable mitigation scenario. Therefore, the low carbon scenario assumes that an additional 200,000 acres (81,000) Ha is converted to agroforestry between the years 2018 and 2022. This is equivalent to an average afforestation rate of 16,200 Ha per year over the 5 years. In the NCCAP, SNC and the NDC Sector Analysis, was assumed that an addition 281,000 Ha of land would be converted to agroforestry between 2015 and 2030.

It builds on the previous Action Plan spanning the period 2013-2017. The NCCAP consists in three documents, including an Adaptation Technical Analysis Report (volume II), and a Mitigation Technical Analysis Report (volume III).\n\nThe Plan seeks in particular to: 1) reduce risks to communities and infrastructure resulting from climate-related disasters such as droughts and floods, 2) Increase food and nutrition security through enhanced productivity and resilience of the agricultural sector in as low- carbon manner as possible, 3) Enhance resilience of the Blue Economy and water sector by ensuring access to and efficient use of water for agriculture, manufacturing, domestic, wildlife and other uses, 4) Increase forest cover to 10% of total land area; rehabilitate degraded lands, including rangelands; increase resilience of the wildlife and tourism sector, 5) Mainstream climate change adaptation into the health sector; and increase the resilience of human settlements, including improved solid waste management in urban areas, 6) Improve energy and resource efficiency in the manufacturing sector, and 7) Climate-proof energy and transport infrastructure; encourage electricity supply based on renewable energy; encourage the transition to clean cooking; and develop sustainable transport systems."}
