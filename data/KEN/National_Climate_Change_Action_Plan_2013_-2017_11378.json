In order to get the technology operational in Kenya it is crucial that the following enabling actions be undertaken: improved rates of waste collection and disposal; creation of a regulatory framework that allows for the rights to landfill gas to be licensed for developers for capture and use; plans for future landfills to allow for landfill gas to be captured and utilised; and creation of financial incentives for households to install methane capture facilities for energy generation."}, {"text_block_id": "p253_b519", "text": "63"}, {"text_block_id": "p185_b519", "text": "The KFS is requested to lead the work to reforest degraded forests.
