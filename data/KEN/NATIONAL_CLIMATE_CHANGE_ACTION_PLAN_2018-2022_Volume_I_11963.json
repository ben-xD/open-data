It builds on the previous Action Plan spanning the period 2013-2017. The NCCAP consists in three documents, including an Adaptation Technical Analysis Report (volume II), and a Mitigation Technical Analysis Report (volume III).\n\nThe Plan seeks in particular to: 1) reduce risks to communities and infrastructure resulting from climate-related disasters such as droughts and floods, 2) Increase food and nutrition security through enhanced productivity and resilience of the agricultural sector in as low- carbon manner as possible, 3) Enhance resilience of the Blue Economy and water sector by ensuring access to and efficient use of water for agriculture, manufacturing, domestic, wildlife and other uses, 4) Increase forest cover to 10% of total land area; rehabilitate degraded lands, including rangelands; increase resilience of the wildlife and tourism sector, 5) Mainstream climate change adaptation into the health sector; and increase the resilience of human settlements, including improved solid waste management in urban areas, 6) Improve energy and resource efficiency in the manufacturing sector, and 7) Climate-proof energy and transport infrastructure; encourage electricity supply based on renewable energy; encourage the transition to clean cooking; and develop sustainable transport systems."}
