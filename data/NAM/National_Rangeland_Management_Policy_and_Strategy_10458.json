Seasonal rainfall patterns will be more erratic and Namibia will experience droughts more frequently. Predictions of rainfall are highly uncertain,ranging from a small increase of 30 mm per year to severe decreases of 200 mm below the current annual average at any particular place in Namibia. The greatest impact is predicted for the central inland areas. Evaporation is anticipated to rise by 5% per degree of warming. So, even if rainfall remains unchanged, the availability of water is likely to decrease. Water is already a scarce resource in Namibia, so decreases in rainfall and in-creases in evaporation will have an unfavourable effect on our biological and economic growth. The expected lower level of biomass production, as well as the influence of more frequent wildfires, will reduce the quantity of plant litter available to replenish soil organic matter. In addition, higher temperatures will accelerate mineralisation of soil organic matter. The optimal temperature range for many soil organisms will be exceeded, so that soil microbial and faunal species composition will change. Namibian forage quality and quan-tity are already highly variable within seasons, as well as between seasons, and this is likely to get worse in future. It is expected that net primary productivity will be reduced substantially throughout much of the country by 2050. It is expected that grassy savannahs will lose their spatial dominance to desert and shrub land savannah vegetation types. It is further predicted that arid vegetation types will increase their cover by up to 20% by 2050, and up to 43% by 2080 in the absence of a CO² fertilisation effect. There will be changes in species suitability for specific areas and particularly shifts in the ranges of C3 and C4 species. C4 species will probably retreat in a northeasterly direction, with C3 species (including bush) filling this gap. These conditions will render an already vulnerable land user/ manager community even more vulnerable. Rangeland managers/users will have to take this into consideration in their long-term planning. Namibian farmers will have to diversify their sources of income to relieve the land from an ever-increasing grazing pressure.

In arid areas soil organic material comes to a large extent from the die-back of plant roots.

Organic material plays a significant role in the improvement of soil structure. Not only does a better soil structure create conditions for better water infiltration, it also enhances soil aeration and thus microbe activity. These microbes, some of which have a decomposing function, are responsible for breaking down waste products and for the recirculation of nutrients in the ecosystem. Others, such as aerobic nitrogen fixating organisms, fix organic nitrogen in an inorganic form that can be incorporated into biological processes. Due to the fact that Namibia is such a dry country, conditions are not very conducive to microbe activity, and the soils have a notoriously low organic material content. Good management is therefore all the more important to improve these characteristics of our soils. A good cover of the soil by plants and organic material (litter) also results in fewer extremes of soil temperatures, which can be conducive to germination of grass seed and seedling establishment. Lower daytime soil surface temperatures also restrict soil water losses as a result of evaporation.

In order to prevent the project from becoming a cost burden for the farmer or the government, the key aim should be to strengthen the vertical integration of bush products and to develop and broaden the marketing of those products.

These farmers are familiar with all the techniques and many of them have applied a variety of methods in practice already. However, it could be expected that for the majority the need for technical assistance still exists, especially for those who were not involved in any bush control programmes before. The non-title deed farmers, on the other hand, expressed an urgent need to obtain more information about encroacher bushes, the causes of encroachment, and how to combat it. Many of these farmers lacked a basic knowledge about environmental issues, and this needs to be dealt with accordingly as well. Thus, an intensive training programme is proposed to improve the theoretical and practical skills of extension and research officers in order to assist farmers on a continuous basis. A comprehensive extension programme with intermittent short courses should be launched for the farming community. In this regard key personnel, responsible for carrying out the training programmes, should be identified. Farmers with a wealth of experi-ence should also be used as trainers.
