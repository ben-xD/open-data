In addition, the General Electricity Law grants authority to the Electricity Sector Regulatory Commission to provide incentives (not specified in the law) to encourage improved technological efficiency; and to participate in the regulation of efficiency standards for electric devices officially issued by the Standards and Meteorology Corporation.<br />\n<br />\nPrevious additions to the law passed in 2002 allowed private energy companies to access to the electricity grids as well as set guidelines for renewable energy projects. Large-scale projects (above 5MW) would be contracted through competitive tendering (no longer necessary due to the provision in the renewable energy law), small-scale (below 5MW) through direct negotiations and very small scale (below 1MW) for auto-generation and only to be bought during peak demand."}
