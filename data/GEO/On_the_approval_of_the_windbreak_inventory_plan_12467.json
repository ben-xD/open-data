Windbreaks are a type of hedgerow made of tress or shrubs and that protect farmed fields, notably from wind. Harm to windbreaks is currently a prominent cause of decreasing crop yields in the country. The law does not mention climate change but the protection of windbreaks generates adaptation and mitigation responses.Â The law also sets rules on agencies and private parties that are authorised to deal with windbreaks and introduces financing schemes."}
