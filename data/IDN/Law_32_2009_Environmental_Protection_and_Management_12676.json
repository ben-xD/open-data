It seeks to ensure that development is underpinned with the principle of sustainably and environmentally sound development principles.<br />\n<br />\nIn practice this means that environmental protection and management should be integrated into all efforts to preserve the functioning of the environment, which includes the development of environmental monitoring programmes and development project impact evaluations.It concerns ecosystem integrity (such as forest ecosystems, which is why the legislation is relevant to REDD+) but also the release of toxic materials into the environment."}
