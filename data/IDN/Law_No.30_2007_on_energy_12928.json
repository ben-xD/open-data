In terms of supply-side policies, it requires that more attention should be given to new and renewable energy development and that incentives should be developed for energy providers to do so. It includes a target to increase the share of renewables from 4.3% in 2005 to 15% by 2025.<br><br>The Law promotes national energy efficiency. There are a series of measures proposed to achieve this. First is the creation of an inventory of energy resources. Then, energy stocks resources should be increased. Furthermore, the energy supply should be diversified, with a simultaneous promotion of energy conservation. The Law also addresses the distribution network, with the goal of improving the quality of storage and transmission.<br><br>The Law also requires that energy is provided for under-developed, remote and rural areas by exploiting local energy potential, and renewable energy in particular. Throughout these developments, there should be a prioritisation of environmentally friendly technologies."}
