It is revised and re-implemented every five years over a period of twenty years. The First Energy Master Plan was introduced in 2008. The Plan is based on Article 41 of the Basic Law on Low Carbon Green Growth and Clause 1 of Article 10 of the Energy Law. The current version as of 2021 is the Third Energy Master Plan. It aims to achieve sustainable growth, enhance quality of life, and serve as a mid- and long-term vision for Korea’s energy transition.  The document deals with trends and prospects of domestic and overseas demand and supply of energy, on matters concerning 1) measures for stable import, supply, and management of energy, 2) the targets energy demand, energy sources, energy efficiency, 3) the supply and use of renewable energy, 4) measures for the safety control of energy, and 5) the development and diffusion of technology related to energy, the training of professional human resources, international cooperation, the development and use of natural resources of energy, and welfare in energy.  Plans under the scope of this document include supply side plans and demand management and other low-carbon plans."}
