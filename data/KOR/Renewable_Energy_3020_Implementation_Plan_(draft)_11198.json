The document adopts policy changes and seek an amendment of the Electricity Business Act accordingly. It charges the Minister of Commerce, Industry and Energy to establish a plan for electricity supply in accordance with the present targets and Implementation Plan, taking into account economic efficiency, the environment and general safety.  The Plan sets an objective of 20 % share of electricity production obtained from renewables by 2030, while natural gas would reach 18.8 %, and both coal and nuclear decreasing to 36.1 % and 23.9 % respectively. This corresponds to an installed capacity of renewable energy, with solar and wind especially favoured, going from from 11.3 GW to 23.3 GW in 2022 and 58.5 GW in 2030. The Plan further details a roadmap to phase-out eleven nuclear power plants, and five new projected plants. These targets are also expressed in objectives of GHG emissions reductions to 2030.  The Plan is expected to be translated into law in the coming year."}
