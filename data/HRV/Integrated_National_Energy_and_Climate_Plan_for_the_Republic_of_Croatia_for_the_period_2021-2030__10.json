They can be divided into:• voltage-dependent i.e. permanent losses resulting from the maintenance of the powersystem in standby mode for the supply of customers with electricity,• electricity-dependent losses i.e. variable losses resulting from the flow of electricitythrough the components of the power system.Based on the assumed changes in load, consumption, investment features and start-up ofindividual facilities, a possible total reduction in technical losses with the implementation of the10-Year Grid Development Plan 2019-2028 is estimated at 284 to 455 GWh (these valuesrepresent cumulative savings in a given period), of which in the first three years (period 20192021) from 8.5 to 13.4 GWh on average per year.

E.g. the numberof transformers with reduced losses will be significantly higher at the end of the ten-year period,therefore the annual savings at the end of the ten-year period will also be higher.Non-technical losses i.e. commercial losses are the consequence of the taken over, i.e.consumed electricity that has, for some reason, not been accounted for. According to theestimate of the share of technical and non-technical losses in the total losses of the distributiongrid, technical and non-technical losses account for about 50% of the total losses.

Sowing intermediate crops that can be used to feed livestock or plow for greenfertilization will utilize residual nutrients, prevent further evaporation of soil water, reducecarbon loss from soil (eliminating the negative effect of \"bare soil\"), prevent nitrogen leachinginto groundwater (especially in lighter soils) and increase organic mass on farms that have anarrow crop rotation on their arable land. Leguminous crops bind nitrogen from the air to enrichthe soil, preserve and stimulate microbial activity in the soil and prevent soil erosion. Theincreased cost of agricultural production per hectare is usually offset by savings in animal feedpreparation or reduced need for mineral fertilizers.

Furthermore, greater utilization of food results in reduced excretionof N compounds in faeces and urine, but also decreases the excretion and thus theirpotential emission. A positive genetic correlation between PME (predicted methaneemission) and RFI (residual feed intake) indicates that cows with lower RFIs alsohave lower potential emissions. Thus, it is possible to reduce methane production incows by selecting genetically more suitable cows with respect to methane emissions.Genetic variability assumes a decrease of 11-26% over a ten-year period, but may begreater by applying a selection programme. However, there are several doubts, suchas the lack of accurate methane measurements (and the main assumption is thatmethane produced per unit of food does not affect RFI levels), as well as predictingthe potential consequences of genetic selection. To overcome these limitations, it isnecessary to collect data on feed intake and methane emissions from dairy cows.• Health status and mortality rate - preserving health is a prerequisite for efficientlivestock production. Positive effects are evident through increased food intake andutilization, higher production, reduced mortality and greater animal welfare.

The aim of this measure is to encourage cities and municipalitiesto build projects for revitalization and development of new urban environments on sustainabilityprinciples. The first step is to develop urban development plans, which, based on theassessment of sustainability indicators, will define development projects that will improve theseindicators. In addition, co-financing from ESI funds will be provided for these projects in theperiod 2021-2027 (2030)..
