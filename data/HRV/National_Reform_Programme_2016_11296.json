Growth in private sector investments will gradually outpace broader public sector investments towards the end of the projection period in terms of strengthening business optimism and improving the investment climate, with persistent structural reforms that will make business easier for entrepreneurs. Despite an estimated acceleration of growth in foreign demand for domestic goods and services, due to the disappearance of the positive effects of re-exports and accession to the common EU market, the real growth of exports of goods and services will be lower in the coming years as compared to 2014 and 2015.
