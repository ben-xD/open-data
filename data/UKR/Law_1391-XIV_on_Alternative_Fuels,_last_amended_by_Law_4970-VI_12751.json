It aims at reducing environmental impact by using various kinds of waste as raw material for the production of alternative fuels. The law foresees support to develop scientific and technical basis of production of alternative fuels, as well as support of entrepreneurship. It aims to prevent the creation of artificial monopolies of alternative fuels.<br />\n<br />\nThe law was amended twice, in 2009 and 2012, firstly to introduce biofuel blending mandates and secondly to introduce a steady increase in biofuels share of the fuel mix.<br />\n<br />\nThe amended law promotes the use of alternative fuels to 20% of the total amount of fuel consumption in 2020. It establishes the amount of ethanol content in gasoline produced and sold: recommended content not less than 5% (by volume) in 2013; mandatory content not less than 5% (by volume) in 2014-2015; and mandatory content of not less than 7% (by volume) from 2016."}
