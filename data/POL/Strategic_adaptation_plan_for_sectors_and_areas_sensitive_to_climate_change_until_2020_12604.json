It also assesses the impact of expected change in the socioeconomic area, and the vulnerability of various sectors of the economy.  The implementation of the SAP 2020 involves 3 stages: the elaboration of the Strategic Adaptation Plan taking into account climate change in the reference period of 1971-2000; the preparation of the Strategic Adaptation Plan for a long-term period, taking into account expected climate change up until 2070-2100; and cost estimation."}
