Each plan sets out the reforms and investments to be implemented by end-2026 and Member States can receive financing up to a previously agreed allocation. Each plan should effectively address challenges identified in the European Semester, particularly the country-specific recommendations of 2019 and 2020 adopted by the Council. It should also advance the green and digital transitions and make Member States’ economies and societies more resilient.<br><br>The Commission validates the plan after which it effectively enters in force and EU subsidies can start flowing towards the member state. <strong>Poland's RRP EC page does not show whether a council implementing decision was passed.</strong>"}
