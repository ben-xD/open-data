The biocomponents and bioliguids can only count towards the quota and be eligible for financial support, if they meet the sustainability criteria set out within the recognized certification system (art. 28b-28c) approved by the European Commission, including GHG emission reduction, protection of land with high biodiversity value, peatland protection and sustainable farming criteria (art. 28a).The Act is detailed by Regulation of 23 July 2013 on the National Indicative Targets for 2013-2018).
