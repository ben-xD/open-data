The key objectives of the strategy include sustainable management of the environment through measures like water management, preservation of biodiversity and effective management of mineral resources. The policy strives to ensure energy supply through measures such as better use of domestic energy resources, improved energy efficiency and modernisation of power industry including development of nuclear power. The policy document also calls for measures to improve the environment through reduction in air pollution, particularly lead, cadmium and particulate matter, cuts in industrial sector water use and better waste management. The government will also work towards carbon capture and storage solutions and gasification of coal, which is expected to remain the nation's main source of energy."}
