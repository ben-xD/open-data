"document_description": "The Strategic Action Plan is related to the National Energy Policy (NEP) that states the Government's policies for the planning and management of the nation's energy sector over the next 10 years. The purpose of the Strategic Action Plan (SAP) is to restate Palau's energy policies in the form of a more detailed action program including specific targets and guidelines. It also provides indicators to measure progress in the implementation of the NEP and the SAP.\n\nThe Plan defines a number of strategies and actions in order to improve 1) institutional arrangements for enery sector management, 2) energy efficiency and conservation, 3) renewable energy harvesting, 4) improve the system of hydrocarbons imports, and 5) electric power in general."}
