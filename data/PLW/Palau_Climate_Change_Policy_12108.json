Palau is vulnerable to both human-induced and natural disasters, which may be exacerbated by climate change. Many of these impacts have already been felt in Palau and will continue to affect all sectors and geographic areas. So far, annual and seasonal maximum temperatures have increased since 1953 at a rate of 0.11°C (0.2°F), per decade, sea level has risen by about 0.35 inches per year since 1993, faster than the global average, and levels of ocean acidification have been rising since the 18th century. 2014 analysis by the Australian Bureau of Meteorology and the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization projects future impacts under the low emissions scenario to include:"}, {"text_block_id": "p12_b174", "text": "Direct Impacts to Natural Systems (relative to 1995; most projections are medium to very high confidence)"}, {"text_block_id": "p12_b175", "text": "•"}, {"text_block_id": "p12_b176", "text": "Sea-level rise of 3.0 to 6.3 inches by 2030 and 11.2 to 25 inches by 2090;"}, {"text_block_id": "p12_b177", "text": "•"}, {"text_block_id": "p12_b178", "text": "Increased frequency and severity of extreme weather events (particularly rain events), with increasing numbers of extreme rainfall days and rainfall intensity;"}, {"text_block_id": "p12_b179", "text": "•"}, {"text_block_id": "p12_b180", "text": "Changes in seasonal and annual rainfall, with projected increases in rainfall during the wet season;"}, {"text_block_id": "p12_b181", "text": "•"}, {"text_block_id": "p12_b182", "text": "Temperature regime changes, with projected increases in mean air temperatures of 0.5°C (0.9°F) to 1.0°C (1.8°F) by 2030 and an increase in the frequency of very hot days;"}, {"text_block_id": "p12_b183", "text": "•"}, {"text_block_id": "p12_b184", "text": "Increasing ocean acidification;"}, {"text_block_id": "p12_b185", "text": "•"}, {"text_block_id": "p12_b186", "text": "Decline in frequency of droughts and decline in typhoons (noting only medium to low confidence in these two specific projections)."}, {"text_block_id": "p12_b187", "text": "Indirect/Exacerbated Impacts to Natural Systems"}, {"text_block_id": "p12_b188", "text": "•"}, {"text_block_id": "p12_b189", "text": "Increased inundation, storm surges, erosion, and other coastal hazards;"}, {"text_block_id": "p12_b190", "text": "•"}, {"text_block_id": "p12_b191", "text": "Changes to quantity, quality, and variability in seasonal and annual flows of surface and underground water;"}, {"text_block_id": "p12_b192", "text": "•"}, {"text_block_id": "p12_b193", "text": "Increased coral bleaching events and increased coral mortality;"}, {"text_block_id": "p12_b194", "text": "•"}, {"text_block_id": "p12_b195", "text": "Declining fisheries and other marine resources;"}, {"text_block_id": "p12_b196", "text": "•"}, {"text_block_id": "p12_b197", "text": "Reduced ecosystem functionality, particularly mangroves as coastal defences and nurseries;"}, {"text_block_id": "p12_b198", "text": "•"}, {"text_block_id": "p12_b199", "text": "Overall loss of marine and terrestrial biodiversity and productivity;"}, {"text_block_id": "p12_b200", "text": "•"}, {"text_block_id": "p12_b201", "text": "Increasing population, diversity, and range of invasive species."}, {"text_block_id": "p12_b202", "text": "Indirect/Exacerbated Impacts to Economic Systems"}, {"text_block_id": "p12_b203", "text": "•"}, {"text_block_id": "p12_b204", "text": "Negative impacts to the economy in the order of 4 to 20% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP), at between US$9.88 to $49.4 million/year;"}, {"text_block_id": "p12_b205", "text": "•"}, {"text_block_id": "p12_b206", "text": "Adverse effects to subsistence and commercial agriculture and fisheries;"}, {"text_block_id": "p12_b207", "text": "•"}, {"text_block_id": "p12_b208", "text": "Direct and indirect declines in income from tourism;"}, {"text_block_id": "p12_b209", "text": "•"}, {"text_block_id": "p12_b210", "text": "Economic losses in households and other sectors, particularly from extreme weather."}, {"text_block_id": "p12_b211", "text": "Indirect/Exacerbated Impacts to Health Systems"}, {"text_block_id": "p12_b212", "text": "•"}, {"text_block_id": "p12_b213", "text": "Reduced food security due to extreme weather events and changes in seasonal weather patterns;"}, {"text_block_id": "p12_b214", "text": "•"}, {"text_block_id": "p12_b215", "text": "Human stress and mortality from extreme weather events;"}, {"text_block_id": "p12_b216", "text": "•"}, {"text_block_id": "p12_b217", "text": "Increases in the incidences and range of water-borne and vector-borne diseases."}, {"text_block_id": "p13_b218", "text": "Adaptation"}, {"text_block_id": "p13_b219", "text": "| Risks and Existing Activities"}, {"text_block_id": "p13_b220", "text": "Risks to Sectors from Direct Impacts of Climate Change"}, {"text_block_id": "p13_b221_merged_merged", "text": "Ten sectors identified by the Ad Hoc Climate Change Committee identified priority risks from impacts from climate change.
