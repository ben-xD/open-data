focuses on strengthening national disaster risk management structures and mechanisms to support the improved integration of disaster management and climate change adaptation to more effectively integrate disaster risk considerations into the national development planning and budgetary allocation process.&nbsp;<br><br>The document aims to allow government and non-government agencies and organisations to refer to relevant parts in order to assist in the development of integrated approach to all emergency responses, preparedness, hasard mitigation, relief and recovery plans and programs. The framework defines disaster risk management and disaster risk reduction measures. This Framework is given full effect by Executive Order No. 397.&nbsp;<br><br>The objectives of the Framework are to: 1) Establish a mechanism for effective control, coordination, decision making, accountability, and organizational arrangements for all aspects of disaster management and disaster risk reduction, 2) Describe organizational arrangements that maximize the use of available resources to strengthen mitigation, preparedness, response, relief and recovery planning based on an all hazards basis and through an integrated approach, 3) Promote integrated planning and collaboration for disaster management and disaster risk reduction across and within all levels of government, departments, sectors and communities, 4) Support the successful implementation of existing and future relevant national, regional and international policy frameworks for disaster risk management and for sustainable development such as the 2020 Palau National Master Development Plan, and 5) Integrate climate change adaptation and disaster management planning and strategy."}
