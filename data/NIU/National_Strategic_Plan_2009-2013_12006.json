The Plan notably charges the government to 1) establish a coordinated disaster risk reduction and management approach to natural and non natural disasters, including climate change, 2) develop and implement a national programme of initiatives to address mitigation and adaptation to climate change and disaster risk reduction and management, 3) promote mitigation measures and implement renewable energy projects, and 4) incorporate climate change issues into relevant sectors.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nThe Plan indicates that Niue's aim is to be 100% carbon neutral by 2013. Niue is exploring renewable energy options to reduce reliance on fossil fuels and is considering energy efficient products such as electric cars and solar powered street lights. The Plan also states that the government should protect and conserve the forest.<br />\n<br />\nA newer version of the plan deals with the period 2014-2019 but was only published as a draft."}
