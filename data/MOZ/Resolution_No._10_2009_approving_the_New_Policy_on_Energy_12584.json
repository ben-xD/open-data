Adopts the strategic objective that Mozambique should align with internationally recognized best practices regarding energy-efficiency, energy mix diversification, and new and renewable sources.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;Directs the expansion of the National Network of Energy Transport [RNT) (e.g. continued expansion of electrification in Mozambique), highlighting the need for electricity in rural areas, as well as the acceleration of the expansion of alternative energy.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;Outlines five global and major challenges that Mozambique needs to address in the coming decades:<br>&nbsp;1) increased risk of ruptures in energy supply;<br>&nbsp;2) threat of environmental degradation due to energy production;<br>&nbsp;3) lack of access to energy by economically disadvantaged;<br>&nbsp;4) sustainability of energy; and<br>&nbsp;5) diversification of the energy matrix<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;Outlines Mozambique's energy policy vision, mission, and principles of strategy.<br>1) The vision: to ensure the availability of energy at a national level to meet the challenges of sustainable socio-economic development<br>2) The Mission: to sustainably improve access to energy<br>3) The Principles:<br>&nbsp;o Sustained increased access to electricity and fuel<br>&nbsp;o Sustainable use of woody biomass<br>&nbsp;o Spread of new and renewable energies<br>&nbsp;o Diversification of energy sources<br>&nbsp;o Sustainable production of biofuels to substitute imported fuels<br>&nbsp;o Integrated energy planning across sectors<br>&nbsp;o Sustainable development and preservation of the environment<br>&nbsp;o Adoption of tariffs to reflect real costs of adverse environmental impacts<br>&nbsp;o The efficient use of energy<br>&nbsp;o Encouraging private and scientific involvement, spurring investment in research and development of new technologies<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;Provides an analysis of the energy mix and reaffirms the responsibilities of the Ministry of Energy to develop energy sector policies, long-term plans, and ensure their implementation. Outlines strategic objectives related to the development of hydroelectric generation, wind, geothermal, biomass, biogas, solar and demand side energy-efficiency."}
