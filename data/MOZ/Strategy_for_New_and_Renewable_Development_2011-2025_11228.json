Specifically proposes, for off-grid systems to:</div><ul><li>begin a large-scale PV programme for lighting and water pumping systems</li><li>begin a large-scale solar PV water and space heating programme</li><li>approve regulations relative to a solar PV water and space heating programme</li><li>establish fiscal incentives and licensing to stimulate private sector investment</li></ul><div>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;Devises specific fiscal incentives for off-grid investments in renewables, including: tax exemptions of equipment imports, VAT exemptions for rural electrification and expansion projects, and corporate tax exemptions for foreign companies who seek to expand rural electrification. Additionally, pursuant to this strategy a Solar PV Feed-in-Tariff has been proposed. Nevertheless, the above fiscal incentives have yet to be structured."}
