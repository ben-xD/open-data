In 2008 it was levelled off at CHF0.0275 (USD0.0287)/tonne/km.  It differentiates according to three aspects: ? Distance travelled in Switzerland ? Gross weight ? Pollution intensity of the vehicle based on EURO classes/ emission standards It applies to road vehicles over 3.5 tonnes and aims at internalising the external costs of road transportation, especially goods in transit through Switzerland.  The revenue is shared between the cantons (1/3) and the federal government (2/3). While the cantons predominantly use the revenues as compensation for road costs they incur, the revenues attributed to the federal government are invested into rail transportation projects such as Rail 2000, New Transalpine Rail Routes (NEAT), links to the European high-speed network and rail noise control programmes."}
