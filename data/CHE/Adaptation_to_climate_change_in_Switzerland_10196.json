It is spilt into two parts. The Strategy describes the goals, challenges and fields of action in adapting to climate change in Switzerland. The overall goal of the strategy is to seize the opportunities provided by climate change, to minimise climate change related risks and to improve the adaptive capacity of society, the environment and the economy.  The first part examines the climate change impacts and identifies the most important fields of action of adaptation to climate change in the following sectors: - Natural hazard management - Water management - Agriculture - Forestry - Energy - Tourism - Biodiversity management - Health - Spatial development.  The second part of the strategy is an action plan to reach the strategy's goals. These measures are co-ordinated between the federal offices in order to address the challenges posed by climate change, i.e., effects of heat waves in urban areas, droughts, floods, increasing slope instabilities in the Alps, decreasing snow cover, adverse effects on water, soil and air quality, changes in biodiversity, and the potential spreading of invasive species, vermin and infectious diseases. The adaptation measures need to be carefully aligned with other cross-cutting strategies of the Federal Council.  12 cross-sectoral challenges are identified, including: - Greater heat stress on agglomerations and cities - Increasing levels of summer drought - Greater risk of flooding - Decreasing slope stability and more frequent mass wasting - Rising snowline - Impaired water, soil and air quality - Change in habitats, species, composition and landscapes - Spread of harmful organisms, diseases and alien species.  Co-ordinated approach includes the following: - Working with the cantons, cities and municipalities - In the context of sectoral policies - Cross-collaboration and coordination - International cooperation on adaptation to climate change -International climate negotiations - Adapting to climate change in Europe - Collaboration with neighbouring countries."}
