As CO2 emission reductions were not on track to meet the commitments, the CO2 tax was increased to CHF36 (USD37.6) per tonne of CO2. The revenues of the first phase (2008-2010) were re-distributed to employers and to the population on a per-capita basis. Since 2010, one third of the revenues have been channelled to the building refurbishment programme (about CHF300m, USD313m)."}
