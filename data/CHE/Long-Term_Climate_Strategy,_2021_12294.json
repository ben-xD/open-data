The retreat of the alpine glaciers, whose volume has declined by around 60 per cent since the mid-19th century, is clearly visible. The number of days of snowfall per year has also fallen. At 2,000 metres above sea level, this is 20 per cent lower today than in 1970, and at 800 metres above sea level it only snows half as often as it did at that time. The vegetation period today is two to four weeks longer on average than 50 years ago. Climate change is also putting greater pressure on biodiversity and posing a threat to tradi-tional habitats. The climate changes are also having an impact on health.

As an impact analysis conducted on behalf of FOEN shows, the CO2 levy has resulted in significant reductions in emissions since its introduction. It should therefore be continued using the same mechanism as today. Depending on the development of emissions from fuels, the levy rate may be increased from 96 francs per tonne of CO2 at present to a maximum of 210 francs per tonne of CO2 by 2030. The maximum rate possible under the currently applicable law of 120 francs per tonne of CO2 did not have to be applied. If emissions are reduced to a sufficient degree, the maxi-mum rate will not have to be used in future either.

As an impact analysis conducted on behalf of FOEN shows, the CO2 levy has resulted in significant reductions in emissions since its introduction. It should therefore be continued using the same mechanism as today. Depending on the development of emissions from fuels, the levy rate may be increased from 96 francs per tonne of CO2 at present to a maximum of 210 francs per tonne of CO2 by 2030. The maximum rate possible under the currently applicable law of 120 francs per tonne of CO2 did not have to be applied. If emissions are reduced to a sufficient degree, the maxi-mum rate will not have to be used in future either. The CO2 levy contributes to the decarbonisation of the heating supply system by making the replacement of fossil-based heating systems with emis-sions-free alternatives more attractive. This gradual and potentially complete replacement over the long term is a key requirement for attaining the net-zero target.\n* The buildings programme will be continued indefinitely and will now be managed by the Climate Fund.

To drive forward the introduction of district heating networks, investments in the construction or expansion of heating networks and heat generation systems can be guaranteed. The Climate Fund can also make a contribution to communes for spatially coordinated energy-relating planning and support production plants for renewable gas. The buildings programme and the additional measures will contribute, on one hand, towards ensuring the energy consumption of buildings falls further towards the technically feasible and economically viable minimum. On the other, they will support renewable energies and the installation of local and district heating systems as a replacement for inefficient, decentralised solutions in the field of heating.\n* Responsibility for the energy-related buildings measures lies primarily with the cantons.

Two-thirds of the revenues will be returned to the population and the economy which also makes them socially ac-ceptable. As an impact analysis conducted on behalf of FOEN shows, the CO2 levy has resulted in significant reductions in emissions since its introduction. It should therefore be continued using the same mechanism as today. Depending on the development of emissions from fuels, the levy rate may be increased from 96 francs per tonne of CO2 at present to a maximum of 210 francs per tonne of CO2 by 2030. The maximum rate possible under the currently applicable law of 120 francs per tonne of CO2 did not have to be applied. If emissions are reduced to a sufficient degree, the maxi-mum rate will not have to be used in future either. The CO2 levy contributes to the decarbonisation of the heating supply system by making the replacement of fossil-based heating systems with emis-sions-free alternatives more attractive. This gradual and potentially complete replacement over the long term is a key requirement for attaining the net-zero target.\n* The buildings programme will be continued indefinitely and will now be managed by the Climate Fund.

The Climate Fund can also make a contribution to communes for spatially coordinated energy-relating planning and support production plants for renewable gas. The buildings programme and the additional measures will contribute, on one hand, towards ensuring the energy consumption of buildings falls further towards the technically feasible and economically viable minimum. On the other, they will support renewable energies and the installation of local and district heating systems as a replacement for inefficient, decentralised solutions in the field of heating.\n* Responsibility for the energy-related buildings measures lies primarily with the cantons.

The emissions limits are a key instrument on the path to green\n -\n house-gas-free transport in view of the development beyond 2030 already defined. Compliance with\n the CO\n 2\n targets requires an increasing share of low-emission drive systems. The effectiveness of this mechanism is already evident: newly registered electric cars (battery-powered electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids) reached a new record high in Switzerland in 2019 with a share of 5.6 per cent. The trend also continued in 2020. The share of electric vehicles stood at 12.1 per cent in the first ten months with the target of 10 per cent â which the industry association 'auto-schweiz' set itself for 2020 â already being surpassed.\n* Manufacturers and importers of fossil fuels are obliged to compensate some of the CO2 emissions from transport. In 2020, the share to be compensated for stood at 10 per cent. The fuel importers can pass on the costs of the compensation measures to consumers under the applicable law with a maximum surcharge of five centimes per litre of fuel. With the complete revision of the CO2 Act, the compensation component can be set within a range of 15 to 90 per cent after consultation with the sector. As a result, the CO2 emissions from transport will be largely offset by compensation measures. Compensation abroad is now also allowable whereby the minimum reduction in Switzer-land must initially amount to 15 per cent, rising to 20 per cent from 2025. These requirements will result in an increase in investment in climate-protection measures. To take account of fuel importers passing on the costs to consumers, the completely revised CO2 Act sets a ceiling for the surcharge."}, {"text_block_id": "p20_b644", "text": "The revision of the Act builds on the exisiting set of measures in the buildings, transport and industry sectors and also incorporates the field of aviation.

Two-thirds of the revenues will be returned to the population and the economy which also makes them socially ac-ceptable. As an impact analysis conducted on behalf of FOEN shows, the CO2 levy has resulted in significant reductions in emissions since its introduction. It should therefore be continued using the same mechanism as today. Depending on the development of emissions from fuels, the levy rate may be increased from 96 francs per tonne of CO2 at present to a maximum of 210 francs per tonne of CO2 by 2030. The maximum rate possible under the currently applicable law of 120 francs per tonne of CO2 did not have to be applied. If emissions are reduced to a sufficient degree, the maxi-mum rate will not have to be used in future either. The CO2 levy contributes to the decarbonisation of the heating supply system by making the replacement of fossil-based heating systems with emis-sions-free alternatives more attractive. This gradual and potentially complete replacement over the long term is a key requirement for attaining the net-zero target.\n* The buildings programme will be continued indefinitely and will now be managed by the Climate Fund.

The Climate Fund can also make a contribution to communes for spatially coordinated energy-relating planning and support production plants for renewable gas. The buildings programme and the additional measures will contribute, on one hand, towards ensuring the energy consumption of buildings falls further towards the technically feasible and economically viable minimum. On the other, they will support renewable energies and the installation of local and district heating systems as a replacement for inefficient, decentralised solutions in the field of heating.\n* Responsibility for the energy-related buildings measures lies primarily with the cantons.

The emissions limits are a key instrument on the path to green\n -\n house-gas-free transport in view of the development beyond 2030 already defined. Compliance with\n the CO\n 2\n targets requires an increasing share of low-emission drive systems. The effectiveness of this mechanism is already evident: newly registered electric cars (battery-powered electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids) reached a new record high in Switzerland in 2019 with a share of 5.6 per cent. The trend also continued in 2020. The share of electric vehicles stood at 12.1 per cent in the first ten months with the target of 10 per cent â which the industry association 'auto-schweiz' set itself for 2020 â already being surpassed.\n* Manufacturers and importers of fossil fuels are obliged to compensate some of the CO2 emissions from transport. In 2020, the share to be compensated for stood at 10 per cent. The fuel importers can pass on the costs of the compensation measures to consumers under the applicable law with a maximum surcharge of five centimes per litre of fuel. With the complete revision of the CO2 Act, the compensation component can be set within a range of 15 to 90 per cent after consultation with the sector. As a result, the CO2 emissions from transport will be largely offset by compensation measures. Compensation abroad is now also allowable whereby the minimum reduction in Switzer-land must initially amount to 15 per cent, rising to 20 per cent from 2025. These requirements will result in an increase in investment in climate-protection measures. To take account of fuel importers passing on the costs to consumers, the completely revised CO2 Act sets a ceiling for the surcharge.\n* Biogenic fuels can replace gasoline and diesel, thus reducing CO\n* Biogenic fuels can replace gasoline and diesel, thus reducing CO\n 2\n* Biogenic fuels can replace gasoline and diesel, thus reducing CO\n 2\n emissions from transport.
