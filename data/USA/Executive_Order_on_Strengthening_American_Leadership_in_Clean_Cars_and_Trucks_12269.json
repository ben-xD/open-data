It notably charges the relevant ministries (namely Transportation and EPA) to establish more stringent multi-pollutant emissions standards.Consistent with this Order, the EPA published the final rule on revised 2023 and Later Model Year Light-Duty Vehicle Greenhouse Gas Emissions Standards on December 21st, 2021. The final rule assesses and disaggregates the monetary benefits of implementing the more stringent standards, notably through reduced impacts of climate change, improved public health from lower pollution, and cost savings for vehicle owners. Further information on rules setting emissions standards for the US road transport fleet can be found here."}
