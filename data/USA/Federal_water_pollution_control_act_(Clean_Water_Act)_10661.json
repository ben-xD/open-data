The Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating shall test or require such testing of the device in accordance with procedures set forth by the Administrator as to standards of performance and for such other purposes as may be appropriate. If the Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating determines that the device is satisfactory from the standpoint of safety and any other requirements of maritime law or regulation, and after consideration of the design, installation, operation, material, or other appropriate factors, he shall certify the device. Any device manufactured by such manufacturer which is in all material reÂ­spects substantially the same as the certified test device shall be deemed to be in conformity with the appropriate standards and regulations established under this section.\n\t\t\t* Every manufacturer shall establish and maintain such records, make such reports, and provide such information as the Administrator or the Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating may reasonably require to enable him to determine whether such manufacturer has acted or is acting in compliance with this section and regulations issued thereunder and shall, upon request of an officer or employee duly designated by the Administrator or the Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating, permit such officer or employee at reaÂ­sonable times to have access to and copy such records. All informaÂ­tion reported to or otherwise obtained by the Administrator or the Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating or their representatives pursuant to this subsection which contains or relates to a trade secret or other matter referred in section 1905 of title 18 of the United States Code shall be considered confidenÂ­tial for the purpose of that section, except that such information may be disclosed to other officers or employees concerned with carÂ­rying out this section. This paragraph shall not apply in the case of the construction of a vessel by an individual for his own use.\n* After the effective date of standards and regulations proÂ­mulgated under this section, it shall be unlawfulâ\n\t\t* for the manufacturer of any vessel subject to such standards and regulations to manufacture for sale, to sell or offer for sale, or to distribute for sale or resale any such vessel unless it is equipped with a marine sanitation device which is in all material respects substantially the same as the approÂ­priate test device certified pursuant to this section;\n\t\t* for any person, prior to the sale or delivery of a vessel subject to such standards and regulations to the ultimate purÂ­chaser, wrongfully to remove or render inoperative any cerÂ­tified marine sanitation device or element of design of such deÂ­vice installed in such vessel;\n\t\t* for any person to fail or refuse to permit access to or copying of records or to fail to make reports or provide inforÂ­mation required under this section; and\n\t\t* for a vessel subject to such standards and regulations to operate on the navigable waters of the United States, if such vessel is not equipped with an operable marine sanitation deÂ­vice certified pursuant to this section.\n\t\t* The district courts of the United States shall have jurisdicÂ­tions to restrain violations of subsection (g)(1) of this section and subsections (h)(1) through (3) of this section. Actions to restrain such violations shall be brought by, and in, the name of the United States. In case of contumacy or refusal to obey a subpena served upon any person under this subsection, the district court of the United States for any district in which such person is found or reÂ­sides or transacts business, upon application by the United States and after notice to such person, shall have jurisdiction to issue an order requiring such person to appear and give testimony or to apÂ­pear and produce documents, and any failure to obey such order of the court may be punished by such court as a contempt thereof.\n\t\t* Any person who violates subsection (g)(1), clause (1) or (2) of subsection (h), or subsection (n)(8) shall be liable to a civil penÂ­alty of not more than $5,000 for each violation. Any person who violates clause (4) of subsection (h) of this section or any regulation issued pursuant to this section shall be liable to a civil penalty of not more than $2,000 for each violation. Each violation shall be a separate offense. The Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating may assess and compromise any such penalty. No penalty shall be assessed until the person charged shall have been given notice and an opportunity for a hearing on such charge. In determining the amount of the penalty, or the amount agreed upon in compromise, the gravity of the violation, and the demonstrated good faith of the person charged in attemptÂ­ing to achieve rapid compliance, after notification of a violation, shall be considered by said Secretary.\n\t\t* The provisions of this section shall be enforced by the SecÂ­retary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating and he may utilize by agreement, with or without reimbursement, law enforcement officers or other personnel and facilities of the AdÂ­ministrator, other Federal agencies, or the States to carry out the provisions of this section. The provisions of this section may also be enforced by a State.\n* Anyone authorized by the Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating to enforce the provisions of this section may, except as to public vessels, (1) board and inspect any vessel upon the navigable waters of the United States and (2) exeÂ­cute any warrant or other process issued by an officer or court of competent jurisdiction.\n\t* In the case of Guam and the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands, actions arising under this section may be brought in the district court of Guam, and in the case of the Virgin Islands such actions may be brought in the district court of the Virgin Islands. In the case of American Samoa and the Trust Territory of the PaÂ­cific Islands, such actions may be brought in the District Court of the United States for the District of Hawaii and such court shall have jurisdiction of such actions.
