These companies or transport facility operators are also required to monitor and report energy use and greenhouse gas emissions, and submit energy efficiency improvement plans on an annual basis to the relevant agencies.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;The Act also consolidates the legislation for mandatory energy labelling and minimum energy performance standards for household appliances, as well as fuel economy labelling of motor vehicles, previously stipulated under the Environmental Protection and Management Act (Cap 94A).<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;The Act is jointly administered by the Ministry of the Environment and Water Resources and Ministry of Transport.
