All facilities producing 25,000 tonnes or more of greenhouse gas emissions in a year will have to pay a carbon tax. The carbon tax will initially be $5 per tonne of greenhouse gas emissions from 2019 to 2023. The Government will review the carbon tax rate by 2023, with plans to increase it to between $10 and $15 per tonne of emissions by 2030."}
