The plan links together DRM, DRR, and climate change adaptation as part of what it envisions to be a holistic planning process, and explicitly recognizes climate change as a major factor in contributing to Kiribati's vulnerability to disasters. The principal function of the National Disaster Risk Management Plan is to define the phases of disaster risk management in Kiribati, which range from readiness to long-term recovery, as well as the roles and responsibilities of government agencies during each phase. It therefore defines general DRM responsibilities that apply to all government bodies, such as maintaining a log of disaster resources and conducting annual review of DRM arrangements, as well as specific responsibilities, such as requiring the Meteorological Office to monitor threats and advise the Office of Te Beretitenti accordingly."}
