The World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg in 2002 set a target of â¢halving the proportion of people who do not have access to basic sanitation by 2015.â¢  Improved sanitation is also essential for achieving the goals of the Pacific Regional Action Plan on Sustainable Water Management endorsed by all Pacific Island National Heads of State during their meeting in Auckland in 2003, and presented to the 3rd WWF in Kyoto.  The Action Plan called for broadly-based national water visions, development of capable institutions, national water action agenda and plans, empowerment of communities and integrated investment plans.  Behavioural change and partnership between communities and government are seen as essential for improvement.\n* The Kiribati National Development Strategy 2004-2007 and the Kiribati Development Plan 2008-2011 include policies and plans of direct relevance to the improved provision of sanitation. The Kiribati Water Sector Road Map, developed by the ADB efforts for the Promotion of Effective Water Management Policies and Practice in 2004, identified the national policies and procedures as a core issue.  The draft Solid Waste Management Policy and Action Plan have identified the impact of solid waste and the leachates on the fresh water resources and the lagoon and foreshore areas.  More recently the National Water Resources Policy and National Water Resources 10-Year Implementation Plan have indentified the need to:\n\t* Increase access to safe basic sanitation removed from water resource areas, and\n\t* Develop a National Sanitation Policy.â¢\n\t* Projects conducted by the international donors over the past decade have included water and sanitation infrastructure improvements and associated educational programs to raise awareness of the importance of safe potable water supplies and adequate sanitation among ordinary I-Kiribati.\n\t* In Kiribati, freshwater is a strategic national resource on which island communities and their economic growth are founded, and where the security of supply and quality needs to be assured.  In most islands freshwater is limited, demand is increasing and the quality is deteriorating under the pressure of human activities, and the uncontrolled presence of animals.  Water-borne diseases are increasingly common, especially among the elderly, the young and other susceptible population groups.

These are:\n\t* Local customs and traditional practices in South Tarawa have dictated a less-than-effective and a higher-cost approach to sanitation;\n\t* Water, sanitation and land tenure issues are interlinked;\n\t* Multi-dimensional projects require effective coordination;\n\t* Organisational and attitudinal change requires time;\n\t* Service improvement requires ongoing community motivation and commitment;\n\t* Service improvement requires sufficient human resources; and\n\t* Simple and least costly solutions will be the most appropriate and sustainable.\n\t* Other relevant lessons come from the approaches being taken by KAP and the Kiribati Urban Renewal Program Scoping Study.Donor funded projects have traditionally been designed with an approach that allows limited community involvement during project design and implementation.  Both projects indentified the need for extensive community consultation with the former study concluding â¢that past development initiatives in South Tarawa have not always adequately addressed the basic needs of communities, especially as they relate to appropriate and affordable solutions for water, sanitation, shelter and security of land tenure.â¢  A community-based approach to enable communities to fully engage in deciding their priorities, weighing the different options, appropriate levels of service in relation to costs, acceptability of the proposals, and monitoring of improvements will be essential for successful and sustainable outcomes and has been allowed for in this Policy.\n\t* This National Sanitation Policy and the accompanying 10-Year Sanitation Implementation Plan are built upon these strategies for community immersion in the choices for sanitation and their implementation.
