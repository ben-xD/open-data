Pollution is mostly caused by the end consumer, since satisfaction of consumer demand stimulates supply, which in turn causes pollution. Consumers should therefore also be responsible for the costs of administration of pollution – containment, reduction and prevention of harm to human health or the environment. However, consumers should also have the right to accurate information on the costs relating to administration of pollution. Therefore, the ‘polluter pays’ principle means that every resource, including energy, consumer and producer, regardless of legal status or social status, is responsible for any kind of emission or pollution resulting from the consumption of the resources in question or from the production of that resource for own consumption or sale to other consumers, and is entitled to be told how those administration costs are applied and used."}, {"text_block_id": "p13_b172", "text": "1.2.
