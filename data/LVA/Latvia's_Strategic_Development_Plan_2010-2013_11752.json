It seeks to combine business and sustainability objectives.\n\nThe document notably emphasises on measures to improve energy efficiency, in the productive sector but also in public and residential buildings. Latvia notably seeks to reduce energy intensity and sectoral emissions, increase the share of local renewable energy resources in the total consumption volume.\n\nAnother main goal of the Plan is to ensure the sustainable management of natural and cultural capitals. This includes the adequate management of forests, and to preserve the country's environment to sustain economic growth while reducing environmental impacts from natural and man-made activities."}
