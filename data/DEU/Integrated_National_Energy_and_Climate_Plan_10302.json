The Federal Government’s goal is to further expand the publicly accessible charging infrastructure, and to have a total of 1 million charging points available in Germany by 2030. To that end, the Federal Government is funding the installation of public charging stations with appropriate programmes up to 2025. In addition to the funding, other measures are required to expand the charging infrastructure. In its Cabinet sitting on 18 November 2019, the Federal Government therefore approved the masterplan for charging infrastructure. The Federal Government will work together with state and local governments, the automobile industry and the energy sector to move ahead with implementing the package of measures for public und non-public charging infrastructure for passenger vehicles and commercial vehicles. In addition to further monetary measures for the funding / financing of charging infrastructure, this also includes legislative measures to improve the legal framework (changes to tenancy and residential property laws, law on buildings and e-mobility infrastructure, amendments to the Charging Stations Regulation), strategic and coordinating actions for nationwide expansion as well as inputs from the commercial sector, especially as regards the provision of necessary information for the tailored development of charging infrastructure and as regards consumer-friendly charging. The consumer is at the heart of the implementation of all measures. E-mobility will only be successful if users accept and are happy with the charging infrastructure available. The sufficient availability of charging infrastructure is a decisive factor in the decision to buy, and as a result the Federal Government aims to provide for an initially disproportionate development of charging infrastructure to prepare the market for anticipated growth. In appropriate exceptional cases of regional market failure, as provided for under European law, distribution network operators will be permitted to construct publicly accessible charging infrastructure. The Federal Government will examine whether a supply obligation could be introduced requiring that charging points also be offered at all filling stations in Germany, and how binding any such regulation could be. Consideration will be given as soon as possible to the issue of whether the construction of rapid charging stations can be treated as a decarbonisation measure by the petroleum industry. Anyone who is unable to offer the 24/7 access condition for publicly accessible charging infrastructure can apply for funding with reduced funding rates via the fifth call for funding (application period 29.4.2020 – 17.6.2020) to the Federal Ministry of Transport and Digital Infrastructure’s charging infrastructure funding programme. Customer car parks in particular can benefit from this. In addition, the vast majority of charging will take place at home or at work. For this reason, a funding programme for shared private and commercial charging infrastructure (e.g. in apartment blocks and in employee car parks) will be published before the end of 2020. In addition, charging at the employer’s premises and the provision of necessary charging infrastructure to the employee are tax privileged, i.e. they need not be taxed as a salary component. Changes to residential property laws and tenancy rights are intended to facilitate the construction of charging infrastructure. Apartment owners and tenants are in principle to be granted an entitlement to the installation of charging facilities, which the remaining apartment owners and the landlord can refuse only in certain limited circumstances. Further regulatory obstacles to the expansion of charging infrastructure will also be removed (among other things, by provision of accelerated grid connection of charging infrastructure in the ordinance regulating grid connection, legal certainty when calculating shares in the costs, controllability / load management of charging infrastructure for grid-appropriate charging, and user-friendly charging and charging infrastructure in the public sphere). In 2019, the National Charging Infrastructure Control Centre (Nationale Leitstelle Ladeinfrastruktur) was set up to oversee the coordinated ramp-up of public charging infrastructure at the various levels (federal / state / local governments)."}, {"text_block_id": "p229_b44", "text": "Terminology used regarding the number of responses"}, {"text_block_id": "p151_b44", "text": "The heating and cooling sector covers space heating, hot water, process heating, process cooling and district heating.

A system of carbon-differentiated truck tolls favouring climate-friendly propulsion systems, and the necessary amendment of the Eurovignette Directive, will also be pursued. The Federal Government aims to introduce a carbon surcharge on the truck toll, effective from 2023, utilising the legal scope. The European regulatory framework for any such carbon surcharge and any differentiation is currently being worked out in the competent Council working groups on the amendment of the Eurovignette Directive. The present infrastructure charge for carbon-neutral alternative drive systems is to be reduced by 75%. The adoption of the revised Directive necessitates a subsequent transposition into German law. With the carbon fleet regulation for commercial vehicles, a powerful regulatory instrument has already been adopted at European level. It seeks to ensure that fleet-and Europe-wide carbon emissions will be reduced by 30% (for heavy commercial vehicles) and by 31% (for light commercial vehicles) by 2030. To achieve the GHG reduction targets of the transport sectors overall, however, there must be an even higher rate of reduction for commercial vehicles. The fleet regulation must therefore be supplemented by further measures. These accompanying measures set out to address, firstly, the extra costs associated with commercial vehicles with alternative propulsion systems: The development of market-ready commercial vehicles with hydrogen fuel cells will continue to be supported for all segments, so that vehicles with this technology can be offered by the mid-2020s at the latest.

Section 67 (Procurement of supplies or services relevant in terms of energy consumption) of the Regulation on the Award of Public Contracts, which must be complied with by all public contracting authorities participating in EU-wide calls for tenders, states that the highest level of energy efficiency and (where available) the highest energy efficiency class must be required if the goods being procured are relevant in terms of energy consumption or if such goods represent a key prerequisite for provision of a service. Energy efficiency must also be used as a criterion when evaluating the economically most advantageous tender.

Over and above this obligation, the Unfair Competition Act, the Regulation on the Award of Public Contracts, the Public Procurement Rules for Services – Part A, Section 1, and for Construction Services – Part A and the Public Procurement Rules for Defence and Security also call for this type of procurement.

This restriction on the balancing options ensures that any excess quantities will only ever be offset within the limited total emissions level under the EU Climate Protection Regulation. The overall structure of the national emissions trading system has thus been geared towards an emission budget that is limited in total from the outset. The use of flexibility options is not unusual in other emissions trading systems; in the EU ETS, for example, this takes place via the possibility of using emission credits from international climate protection projects. The emission allocations are transferable and can be traded. After the introductory phase from 2021-2025, the emission allocations will generally be issued by way of an auction process. The relevant authority will periodically offer the available auction volume in equal subsets. The price of the emission allowances essentially follows the market.
