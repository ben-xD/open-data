The fund is to be used for the promotion of an environmentally-friendly, reliable and affordable energy supply, for instance with respect to energy-efficiency. Revenue will mainly come from a contractual agreement of the nuclear power plant operators with the German state that skims off part of their extra profits. In addition, it will be funded by parts of the nuclear fuel rod tax and the auctioning of emission allowances as of 2013."}
