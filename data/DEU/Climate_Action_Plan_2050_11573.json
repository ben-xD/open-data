Those that are successful must be permanently established and expanded.

The German government’s environmental tax reform in 1999 is an important ex-ample of this. It will therefore also have to be determined how the system of taxes and levies can be improved in a way that will allow climate action targets to be progressively achieved by 2050. In that regard, it must be remembered that environmental damage caused by individuals, as well as the failure of society and business to protect the environment, usually result in higher costs than those associated with improving the system of taxes and levies. In some cases, those external costs have not been adequately passed on to polluters; in other words, they have not been internalised. The government will increase the economic incentives for polluters to reduce environmental damage and move in the direction of sustainable production and con-sumption.

The plan includes processes for monitoring progress and updating the plan if necessary in line with the five-yearly stocktake of the NDCs specified in the Paris Agreement. The main goal of the plan is to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. The interim goal of the plan is to reduce Germany's total emissions by 55 percent by 2030, compared to 1990.&nbsp;<br><br>Concrete measures to achieve these targets laid out by the plan include: (1) establish a governmental commission to addressing the question of how to combat climate change while maintaining growth and development, (2) developing more robust energy standards for new buildings and those undergoing substantial renovation, (3) formulate a complete strategy for reducing emissions in the transportation sector, (4) launching a research and development programme aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions from industrial processes, (5) fully implement existing provisions governing fertiliser use, (6) improving carbon sequestration through afforestation, and (7) strengthen economic incentives, including taxes, to encourage polluters to reduce their emissions."}
