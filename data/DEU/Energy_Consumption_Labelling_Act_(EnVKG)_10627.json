It stipulates the labelling requirements for products with regard to their energy consumption, consumption of other important resources, and their carbon footprint. This may take the form of labels indicating consumption, product information, or advertising information.<br />\n<br />\nThe 2012 amendment transposes the EU Energy Labelling Directive into national law. It introduces new classes of labelling (previously only A-G, now up to A+++), and introduces an amendment that means that not only energy-consuming equipment, but also energy-related products, which themselves do not consume energy, but can have great impact on energy consumption, are marked with the EU energy label."}
