The percentage involved depends on the type of energy used and ranges from 15% for solar energy to 50% for biofuel. However, the obligation to meet heat demand using renewables may be replaced by other measures, e.g., high-performance CHP plants.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;It is hoped that the share of renewables in heat supply will be increased from the current 6.6% to 14% in 2020. An annual EUR500m (USD 627.5m) in funding will be made available up to 2012 to promote energy efficiency in buildings."}
