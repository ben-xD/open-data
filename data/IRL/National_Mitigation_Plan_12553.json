The \"whole-of-Government\" Plan aims at setting Ireland on a decarbonisation pathway to 2050. The Plan further includes 100 actions for various Ministers and public bodies to implement its strategy. The Government recognises that this document does not constitute a \"complete roadmap\" to achieve the 2050 decarbonisation objective, but develops a medium to long term action. The document outlines the emissions profiles, policy frameworks and strategies to achieve climate change mitigation at the national level, and in each of the following sectors: 1) electricity generation, 2) the built environment, 3) transport, and 4) agriculture, forestry and land use. It further quantifies costs and emissions reductions potentials."}
