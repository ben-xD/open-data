Act of 1999, and it establishes the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) as the main actor whereby the functions of this Act are assigned to. The functions of the SEAI are:</div><ul><li>To promote and assist environmentally and economically sustainable production, supply and use of energy</li><li>To promote and assist energy efficiency and renewable sources of energy</li><li>To promote and assist the reduction of GHG emissions and transboundary air pollutants associated with the production, supply and use of energy</li><li>To promote and assist the minimising of the impact on the environment of the production, supply and use of energy</li><li>To promote and assist research, development and demonstration of technologies connected with the abovementioned objectives</li><li>To provide advice, information and guidance to Ministers, ministerial bodies and energy suppliers and users relating to the abovementioned matters</li></ul><div>&nbsp;The SEAI has the powers necessary to perform abovementioned functions. This includes the following: cooperating with the Central Statistics Office and acting as an agent of the Office; licensing, regulation and control of activities; initiation, development, administration, promotion of and participation in schemes and programmes.<br>&nbsp;An amendment in 2012 conferred a number of additional responsibilities on the SEAI to give affects to EU Directives. The SEAI is required to develop a scheme of certification or equivalent qualification, for installers of renewable energy sources, including biomass, solar thermal systems, shallow geothermal systems and heat pumps. It is to provide information on the availability, environmental benefits and net cost benefits of these energy sources and make guidance available to other consumers, in particular planners and architects, in relation to uses of energy from renewable sources in planning and building or renovating industrial or residential areas. The SEAI should work to raise awareness of, and offer training programmes relating to, renewable sources in order to inform the public as comprehensively as possible of their benefits and practicalities. It must therefore encourage the use of certain, particularly efficient, biomass technologies, heat pumps and solar thermal energy technologies as well as other appropriately certified equipment based on European standards.<br>&nbsp;A 2014 amendment introduced the certification scheme for installers of biomass, heat pump, shallow geothermal, solar photovoltaic and solar thermal energies. Installer certification or qualification shall be given by accredited training programme or training provider."}
