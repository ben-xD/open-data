In order to qualify for the plan, private citizens or organisations exchange a diesel vehicle with more than 10 years of age for a voucher that can be used to subsidise the purchase of a new, more efficient vehicle within 12 months. The value of the voucher is to be stipulated by the Ministry of energy and Mines and financed by the same in addition to the Ministry of Transport and Communication."}
