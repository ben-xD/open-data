As such, most of the legislation is unrelated to climate change or the natural environment. However, it states explicitly that regional governments must formulate, co-ordinate, manage and supervise regional strategies to address climate change within the national framework (the National Strategy on Climate Change and additional legislation, executive decrees and ministerial resolutions)."}
