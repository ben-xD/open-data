Public services in education and health have also expanded significantly. Despite such achievements, however, progress in resolving inequality and creating social fairness has been rather slow. Many dimensions of inequality have persisted as challenging issues. These include income inequality across population groups, and inequality in the quality of public services, particularly among the disadvantaged groups and the population in remote areas. These groups of people also face relatively limited access to justice. Additionally, there are many current conditions and risk factors that are likely to widen inequality in the future. Transitioning into an ageing society with a shrinking working-age population means that the dependency ratio will increase. The burden from a higher number of dependents will impose limitations on people’s ability to save. At the same time, some groups of population still lack financial literacy, which may lead to them becoming elderly poor in the future. Technological advancements tends to benefit those with access, most of whom are people with high skills, who are able to gain higher returns. This will consequently leave a wider gap to the incomes of the low-skilled population without access to such technology. On the other hand, technology can also enable people in remote areas to gain access to education, knowledge and health services. Accordingly, the issue of inequality needs to be tackled urgently in the Twelfth Plan such that it does not become an impediment to the country’s economic and social development towards high-income status. To achieve this, all development dimensions -including economic, social, environmental, regional and urban, as well as public administration -have to be integrated. Therefore, creating a just society and reducing inequality will require the incorporation of other development strategies of the Twelfth Plan as enabling measures. For instance, the strategy for strengthening sustainable economic development and competitiveness will enhance the opportunity for communities and labor to acquire the benefits of development; the strategy on green growth for sustainable development emphasizes fair distribution of land; the strategy for public administration, corruption prevention and good governance aims at raising social fairness; and the strategy on regional, urban and economic area development will complement the dispersion of growth and income."}, {"text_block_id": "p1_b7", "text": "The Twelfth National Economic and Social Development Plan (2017-2021) was formulated during a period when the world was experiencing rapid change and becoming even more integrated, whilst Thailand itself was undergoing reforms.

Measures to achieve this include:\n\t* Enhance the access of disadvantaged children and youths to uninterupted quality education without being limited by family conditions, location and personal physical conditions. Holistic measures should be implemented for poor students in remote areas, covering income-creation for their families and support with school-related transportation expenses. Also, the selection process for the scholarships for poor students given by the Office of the Basic Education Commission (OBEC) should be improved. At the same time, scholarships for higher education should be put in place to prevent drop-outs.\n\t* Provide additional mechanisms to ensure accessibility of the bottom 40 percent to public health services, particularly those in remote areas. Mechanisms to assist and support community welfare that cover transportation expenses to the closest public health facilities should be promoted. Also, proactive health services e.g. counseling, control and prevention of non-communicable diseases (NCDs), and sanitation promotion should be fostered at the community level.\n\t* Enhance land-ownership opportunities along with provision of income-generating measures by promoting sustainable and holistic land access rights. Measures include land allocation to landless poor farmers, with conditions preventing the transfer of land to investors; skills-training; financial provision for job-creation; and expansion of opportunities to access professionally-relevant information, news and knowledge. Moreover, support with marketing and financial management should also be promoted. Finally, a land\n* Impose a more-redistributive fiscal policy that effectively favors the low-income population by imposing more wealth-based taxation and enhancing the efficiency of tax collection. Also, budget allocation should be restructured by giving priority to integrated budgeting and area-based budgeting that targets poverty-and inequality-reduction.\n* Provide additional social welfare for the 40 percent of population with the lowest income in a sufficient and appropriate manner. For instance, provide additional disability allowances and old-age allowances for the poor group to a level sufficient for a living, support with the shelter and utility system to resolve bad conditions in urban slums, and encourage communities to provide services needed by the elderly.\n* Provide additional social welfare for the 40 percent of population with the lowest income in a sufficient and appropriate manner.

The main factors believed to contribute to such low scores are poor nutrition of mothers and children, socio-economic status, as well as child rearing practices and parenting skills, which can pose some negative impacts on the attitudes and behavior of growing up children, resulting in unwanted behavior transiting into the teenage years, especially unprotected sex and lack of contraception knowledge. The adolescent birth rate (aged 15-19 years) in 2014 was 47.9 births per 1,000 women in the same age group. Furthermore, it was also reported that 12.8 percent of women aged 15-19 years old had repeated pregnancies before they reached 20 years of age.

The main reasons behind such low productivity of Thai labors stem from skills and competency mismatches between labor demand and supply, as currently most industries are still very labor intensive, whilst the workforce increasingly has higher educational attainment. Additionally, as many as 60 percent of all Bachelor degree holders are unemployed, while a sample survey by the Ministry of Labor showed that 64 percent of the labor demanded by employers are those with an educational attainment of less than secondary school degree level (M6 and below). Furthermore, Thai labor shows skills and knowledge mismatches in relation to what is demanded by the labor market. According to the employer survey conducted by the Ministry of Labor in 2015, a large proportion of both semi-skilled and skilled Thai workers demonstrated lower-than-expected performance in terms of various skills, including English language, computing, mathematics, communication, management and occupational competency."}, {"text_block_id": "p55_b110", "text": "Elderly people have health-related problems and an increasing tendency to live alone."}, {"text_block_id": "p155_b111", "text": "Part 4"}, {"text_block_id": "p106_b111", "text": "5.1 Plan for Assisting Low-Income Earners:\n* This plan aims at motivating the population\n* Key Implementing Agencies:\n* Operational Timeframe:"}, {"text_block_id": "p55_b111", "text": "It is expected that there will be about 4.6 million elderly people aged 70 years and above by the end of 2016, equivalent to 42.9 percent of the total number of elderly people, and this is forecast to increase to 5.6 million by 2021.

The nation’s working age population reached its peak in 2014 and will be on a path of steady decline thereafter, possibly leading to severe labor shortage problems, which can be further intensified if the existing seemingly low labor productivity problem is not adequately tackled, due to a number of factors, including low quality workforce, delayed technological development, and administrative problems. Such challenges can pose some limitations to the nation’s competitiveness, development, economic growth as well as income generation and well-being improvement of the Thai people. Furthermore, besides quantitative challenges, the qualitative aspect of the Thai people is also considered to be a challenge that needs to be tackled. Problems, despite varying depending on the age groups concerned, are nonetheless interconnected, starting from early childhood. Inadequate early childhood development can very likely lead to poorly performing school age children and a mismatch of skills development for the labor market. The number of elderly people living alone who have health-related problems is expected to be on the rise.

Currently, poverty continues to be concentrated in the Northeast and the North of Thailand. At the same time, income disparities between the richest income decile and the poorest stood at 34.9 times in 2013. The fundamental cause lies in geographical disparities in the quality of social services, an imbalanced economic structure, uneven distribution of development opportunity and unequal access to justice. Moreover, there are relatively fewer opportunities for the population in remote areas to access relevant information, knowledge, financial sources and quality social services. This will tend to bring more risks in the future where rapid technological advancement takes place in every aspect of life, consequently creating wider inequality. Nonetheless, forming networks to resolve community issues through economic, social and environmental activities has improved. Examples include disastermanagement communities and the preparation of community plans formulated by every community before being integrated into sub-district plans, local administration plans, district development plans and provincial development plans, respectively.

As a result, Thailand is facing greater pressure and risk under intensified globalization, moving towards a world with no boundaries – free mobility of manpower, goods and services, investment, knowledge, as well as data and information. Consequently, global competition has become more severe; economic bloc formation has been prevalent; R&D in ST&I effort has been stimulated to increase productivity in many countries. Many new economies have become more competitive, such as Latin America, China, India, and Vietnam. These countries still have lower costs of labor and have used many measures to attract foreign investment. Hence, they can compete well in the marketplace, particularly their primary and secondary industries. Meanwhile, the global economic and political conditions have been unstable. Global economic crises in many regions have occurred more frequently. Moreover, changes in the global landscape, new technological pushes, and closely connected global communities have generated more complex threats and risks, including terrorism, epidemics, international networks of narcotics, and other forms of international crime.

Remarkable progress includes eliminating import tariffs to zero percent for 8,287 items, reducing import tariffs to five percent for sensitive items (coffee, potatoes, dried coconuts, and cut flowers), liberalizing trade in services in 12 main sectors comprising 128 sub-sectors, removing obstacles in all forms of services, and permitting ASEAN investors to hold at least 70 percent of the shares in priority sectors, namely telecommunication and computers, health, tourism, air transport, and logistics. Furthermore, the ASEAN countries have harmonized product standards, and implemented the Mutual Recognition Agreement (MRA) in facilitating ASEAN trade to reduce non-tariff barriers. Now it is harmonizing standards for the 20 product groups, with the majority being electronic equipment, such as air conditioners, refrigerators, radios, and televisions.

For instance, at least ten years experience is required, and within those ten years, large scale projects must have been produced, and continuous learning in engineering conducted. The quality level of architects varies among countries. Moreover, Thailand has listed architects as a reserved career, causing the law amendments to be prolonged. In 2015, only six architects were able to work in ASEAN (as of September 17, 2015). For the health area (medical practitioners, dental practitioners, and nursing services), there has not been much progress in implementation due to the lack of joint curriculum recognition, some moral issues, work permit examination that is conducted in local languages so that health personnel can communicate with patients, and various definitions that have to be accepted both ways. For accountancy services, challenges lie in setting the accounting education standards, specifying the number of hours to provide accounting services under the CPC 826 which varies among countries, and passing a law on fees and registration.

Moreover, the development of infrastructure and other utilities in the targeted areas must support business investments.\n* , especially domestic markets. One measure, in so-doing, is to improve the local procurement system to be more standards-focused. In parallel, compulsory standards should increasingly be applied to more locally-produced and imported products. This will provide the foundation for creating a level playing field for local businesses and for encouraging local entrepreneurs to upgrade their capabilities in producing higher-standard products. On top of this, knowledge of standards and quality should be dissiminated to wider groups of consumers to create awareness and increase domestic demand for high-quality products. Additionally, the capabilities of Thai enterpreneurs must be enhanced to enable them to expand their markets into the high-valued-added segments, especially in creative businesses or niches markets, i.e. the elderly segment, the environment-focused segment, the health-conscious segment, the new lifestyle segment, the high-purchasing power segment, and so on.\n* to capture opportunities from global trends and disruptive technology, Thailand should consider the establishment of new industries, or called âfuture industriesâ, to meet novel and diverse global demand. The prioritized sectors are identified based on Thailandâs existing strengths, including: (1) the robotics and automation industry, which helps support manufacturing productivity improvement. To promote this sector, the initial focus should be on encouraging automation utilization within the manufacturing sector, which will increase local demand and, at the same time, create design capability for robotics and automation systems as a further stage of development; (2) the aviation parts industry can leverage the local strengths of the automotive parts sector. Meanwhile, the development of skilled labor and human resources should be accelerated to support the establishment of an aviation maintenance, repair, and overhaul service sector (MRO) in the future; (3) the medical device and equipment industry, which in the initial stage should focus on establishing strengths in simple devices and equipment manufacturing for import substitution, and to enhance Thailandâs competitiveness in international health services and health tourism. In parallel, R&D capabilities for advanced medical devices and equipment should be strengthened; and (4) the bio-energy industry, to underpin national energy security and utilization efficiency, and to add value in agriculture and the production of bio-based raw materials. Key development approaches for these future industries include:\n* both for a prompt response to industrial demand in the immediate phase, and for establishing a foundation for competitiveness in the long-term phase. This action should be carried out holistically and continuously involving a relentless cooperation effort between the public, private, academic, and research and development sectors.

He/she should have physical and mental well-being as well as spiritual well-being. He/she should apply the Philosophy of the Sufficiency Economy into his/her daily life. Moreover, he/she should manifest Thainess; (2) Income and poverty inequality are reduced. All Thai people should be able to access quality social services equally. The 40 percent with the lowest income (the lowest 40 percent) should have at least 15 percent higher income; (3) The economic system is strong and competitive. The Thai cconomic system should be restructured toward a service and digital economy by supporting new entrepreneurs and becoming an entrepreneurial society. The Thai economy should have strong SMEs that utilize innovation and digital technology in order to create quality goods and services. Technology should also be deployed in order to increase value-added in the production of goods and the provision of services. Thus, the Thai economy should be stabilized. GDP growth would be increased by at least 5 percent annually in order for Thailand to be a high income country by 2036; (4) Natural capital and environmental quality can support green growth as well as food, power, and water security by: increasing the country’s forest area to cover up to 40 percent of the country’s total area in order to maintain a balanced reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the energy and transport sectors by at least 7 percent by the year 2020, compared to a business as usual scenario; increasing efficiency in solid waste disposal; conserving and restoring the quality of water and air in severely affected areas so they should also be able to stabilize the ecosystem up to a healthy standard; (5) National security, independence and sovereignty, social security, social cohesion, positive image, and country confidence are increased.

Key measures include different incentives to encourage enterprises to share knowledge and cooperate in human resource development and joint R&D activities. To achieve this, academic institutions should be supported to perform efficiently as a key mechanism to establish the networks in clusters. Furthermore, building up a strong demand-driven value chain from upstream (agricultural sector) to downstream (distribution and logistics services) should be managed efficiently.\n* in order to build a platform for strong regional value chain linkages within ASEAN, and to increase opportunities for Thai entrepreneurs, especially in SMEs, to insert into global value chains. Rules and regulations need to be renewed to facilitate Thai enterprises to invest in targeted economic areas and utilize investment privileges for acquiring labor and raw materials, and for accessing potential markets. Moreover, the development of infrastructure and other utilities in the targeted areas must support business investments.\n* , especially domestic markets. One measure, in so-doing, is to improve the local procurement system to be more standards-focused. In parallel, compulsory standards should increasingly be applied to more locally-produced and imported products. This will provide the foundation for creating a level playing field for local businesses and for encouraging local entrepreneurs to upgrade their capabilities in producing higher-standard products. On top of this, knowledge of standards and quality should be dissiminated to wider groups of consumers to create awareness and increase domestic demand for high-quality products. Additionally, the capabilities of Thai enterpreneurs must be enhanced to enable them to expand their markets into the high-valued-added segments, especially in creative businesses or niches markets, i.e. the elderly segment, the environment-focused segment, the health-conscious segment, the new lifestyle segment, the high-purchasing power segment, and so on.\n* to capture opportunities from global trends and disruptive technology, Thailand should consider the establishment of new industries, or called âfuture industriesâ, to meet novel and diverse global demand. The prioritized sectors are identified based on Thailandâs existing strengths, including: (1) the robotics and automation industry, which helps support manufacturing productivity improvement. To promote this sector, the initial focus should be on encouraging automation utilization within the manufacturing sector, which will increase local demand and, at the same time, create design capability for robotics and automation systems as a further stage of development; (2) the aviation parts industry can leverage the local strengths of the automotive parts sector. Meanwhile, the development of skilled labor and human resources should be accelerated to support the establishment of an aviation maintenance, repair, and overhaul service sector (MRO) in the future; (3) the medical device and equipment industry, which in the initial stage should focus on establishing strengths in simple devices and equipment manufacturing for import substitution, and to enhance Thailandâs competitiveness in international health services and health tourism. In parallel, R&D capabilities for advanced medical devices and equipment should be strengthened; and (4) the bio-energy industry, to underpin national energy security and utilization efficiency, and to add value in agriculture and the production of bio-based raw materials. Key development approaches for these future industries include:\n* both for a prompt response to industrial demand in the immediate phase, and for establishing a foundation for competitiveness in the long-term phase. This action should be carried out holistically and continuously involving a relentless cooperation effort between the public, private, academic, and research and development sectors. In the immediate phase, it is essential to design and establish a core mechanism with high compentency and flexibility to upgrade effectively the skills of the current industrial workforce and to prepare human resources to supply the new\n* run, it is necessary to promote and facilitate the\n* run, it is necessary to promote and facilitate the\n private sectorâs investment in developing\n* run, it is necessary to promote and facilitate the\n private sectorâs investment in developing\n special skills training institutes or training programs for producing qualified skilled labor to serve rapidly the immediate needs of the targeted future industries. Simultaneously, holistic and systematic planning for the efficient and effective supply of labor in the long-term and the development of targeted human resources for future industries should be deliberately undertaken, with a focus on developing specific skills and competencies to meet the requirements of future industries effectively.\n* by placing a high priority on investments in physical technological infrastructure and mananagment, e.g. the establishment of an incubation system, technology transfer systems to local firms, and the setting up of important testing centres for the targeted industries in order to shift their technology capabilities towards a more advanced level.\n* At the beginning, it will be necessary to have comprehensive studies to support policy makers in deciding a proper strategy to âmake or buyâ technology for the countryâs future industries, especially for industries that have low technological competence. These studies should indicate Thailandâs indigenous technology capabilities and suggest policy guidelines, technology infrastructure, and development systems that can be properly applied for upgrading local firms. Simulteneously, the policy should encourage technology-owning firms to help upgrade local Thai SMEsâ technological capabilities through various strategic incentive measures, e.g. promoting co-investment on R&D and human resource development between technology-owning firms and local SMEs, facilitating the process of bringing in foreign experts in targeted technologies, etc.\n* , particularly laws and regulations regarding investment promotion, import-export, product testing and standardization, research and development, and human resource development. The focus should be on easing procedures and aligning related regulations. In this light, the reduction of any negative social and environmental impact should be highly emphasized in order to generate investor confidence and support the balancing of the economic-social-environmental development of the country."}, {"text_block_id": "p81_b491", "text": "Part 3"}, {"text_block_id": "p169_b492", "text": "3.2"}, {"text_block_id": "p82_b492", "text": "Part"}, {"text_block_id": "p169_b493", "text": "Improve the budget process and establish public fiscal and monetary monitoring and evaluation systems"}, {"text_block_id": "p82_b493", "text": "3"}, {"text_block_id": "p213_b493", "text": "3.1 Regional development to create and distribute economic opportunities:\n* developing towards a high-value creative\n\t* To develop quality and sustainable tourism with\n<\\li2>\n\t\t* Developing potential tourism clusters,\n* Lanna Cultural Tourism Cluster and Ethnic Tourism in Eight Provinces of Upper"}, {"text_block_id": "p169_b494", "text": "to enhance the efficiency of budget allocation and spending, in order to strengthen its timeliness, equitability and contribution to the reduction of inequality.
