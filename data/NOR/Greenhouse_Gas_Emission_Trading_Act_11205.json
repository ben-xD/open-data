It regulates reporting and control related to emissions and allowances and sets out penal measures for those operators not complying with reporting obligations.  It authorises the Norwegian Emissions Trading Registry to contain information on the allocation, issue, holding, transfer, surrender and cancellation of allowances. The pollution control authorities will control and verify the reports on GHG emissions submitted by each operator."}
