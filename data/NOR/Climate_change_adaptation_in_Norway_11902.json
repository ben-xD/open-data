A large number of animal and plant species are included on the Norwegian Red List because their survival in Nor-way is threatened. Species that live in Arctic and mountain areas are adapted to a cold, harsh cli-mate, and are already established as high up or as far north as possible. There is no alternative habi-tat for them to move to. This means that the very survival of species such as the polar bear and ringed seal is threatened. There is little that can be done to counteract this once global warming has happened. The most important means of ensuring the survival of Arctic and alpine species is therefore to cut greenhouse gas emissions. We need to recognise the likelihood that Norway will lose some species as a result of climate change, and that new species will become established.

All in all, climate change entails a risk of changes in the basis for world food production, which may cause instability in food production and food mar-kets. Norway is largely self-sufficient in seafood, meat, eggs and milk, and about half of the popula-tion’s nutritional needs are met by food produced in Norway. Norway is a major seafood exporter, and exported seafood to a value of more than NOK 50 billion in both 2011 and 2012. However, over the past 10 years, the value of annual imports of agricultural goods into the country has dou-bled, and reached about NOK 43 billion in 2012. Climate change that has impacts on food produc-tion in other countries will therefore also affect Norway. If seafood is included, Norway is cur-rently a significant net exporter of food. Climate change, involving for example higher air and sea temperatures, ocean acidification, unstable weather and changes in precipitation, will have impacts on food production in Norway as well. A moderate rise in temperature combined with ade-quate water supplies may allow an increase in our food production, particularly in northern parts of the country and upland areas, but higher tempera-tures and more precipitation may also result in more damage by plant pests such as insects, viruses and fungi, including species that are"}, {"text_block_id": "p22_b655", "text": "already present and new species.

Adaptation work must always be based on the best available knowledge about climate change and how changes can be addressed. The government intends to ensure that the knowledge base for climate change adaptation is strengthened through closer monitoring of climate change, continued expansion of climate change research and the development of a national centre for climate services.  According to the White Paper, adaptation policies and measures should build on the best available knowledge. Thus, the government plans for regular assessments of vulnerability and adaptation needs in Norway. Such assessments will be made if substantial new knowledge is available, related e.g. to the release of the assessment reports of the IPCC."}
