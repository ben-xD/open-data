The Act stipulates that at least 10% of energy for transport must be produced from renewable sources by 2020. It sets the specific sustainability criteria and certification process necessary to fulfil the prescribed quota of biofuel. A 2013 amendment relaxed reporting obligations on fuel traders from monthly to annual. This Act is often referred to as the ?Biofuels Act? as it widely addresses the promotion of biofuel use to reduce GHGs. This Act transposes Directive 2003/30/EC on the promotion of the use of biofuels or other renewable fuels for transport and Directive 2009/38/EC into Hungarian law."}
