During the same period, efforts were made to combat malpractices and corruption through conducting assessment studies particularly in government institutions, government enterprises and other institutions that are carrying out government procurement, land administration, tax and revenue collection and justice administration. Implementation monitoring and evaluation activities were conducted on those sectors for which the assessment study was undertaken. Training on ethics and anti-corruption was conducted for millions of citizens from various community groups to enhance their awareness for zero tolerance to corruption and thereby play their respective roles in fighting corruption and malpractices. Awareness creation education on ethics and corruption was delivered to the public using different communication mediums. In addition, a series of legal measures were taken on individuals who breached laws and regulations including filing corruption charges on business men, Revenue and Customs Authority higher officials and their collaborators. In order to sustaining the progress in combating corruption and malpractices thus far, focus will be given to further strengthen the capacity of the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission and create conducive environment for the participation of the public in building ethical society that rejects and combats corruption."}, {"text_block_id": "p62_b422", "text": "VI.

It sets some targets for energy generation from renewables and biofuels. The Plan focuses on improving the macroeconomic indicators, sectoral economic development plans (e.g. for agriculture and rural transformation, manufacturing, mining, tourism), infrastructure (transport, digital and water supply), human and technology capacity building, good governance and cross cutting issues. New feasible agricultural varieties that are resilient to climate change and have positive contributions for climate resilient green economy development aimed at enhancing agricultural production and productivity will also be identified and disseminated. Other important GTP II goals are protecting forests and re-afforestation including carbon stocks; expanding electricity generation from renewable sources of energy; and leap-frogging to energy efficient technologies in transport, industry and construction.\n\nBuilding a climate resilient green economy is a pillar of the GTP. The plan notably aims at increase forest coverage from 15.5 % to 20%, thus reducing GHG emissions by 147 Mln/Metric tons."}
