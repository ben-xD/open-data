This factor is based on such changes as a shift to higher value crops, better techniques, increased irrigation, and having several harvests a year.

It identifies 20 climate change risks, mainly in the following areas: health risks (human and animal); agriculture production decline; land degradation; water shortages; biodiversity; waste; displacement; distributive justice. The EPACC also identifies institutions responsible for mitigating these risks. Specific adaptation objectives include:</div><ul><li>Reducing impacts of droughts by cloud seeding to induce rain</li><li>Establishing building and construction codes that ensure structures withstand extreme weather events</li><li>Storing food and feed in good years for use in bad years</li><li>Ensuring transportation access to disaster prone areas</li><li>Developing insurance schemes for weather damage compensation</li><li>Organising local communities for quick response to extreme weather events</li><li>Preparing to cater for refugees driven out of their homes by climate change</li><li>Mapping and delineating areas likely to suffer from climate change and extreme weather events</li><li>Developing an accessible information network on climate change</li><li>Developing an early warning system to alert people of impending extreme weather events</li></ul>"}
