The most recent one, Energy Strategy of the Republic of Bulgaria until 2020 was published in 2011. The Energy strategy is worked out by the Ministry of Economy, Energy and Tourism and approved by the Council of Ministers.  The present National Energy Strategy till 2020 reflects the up-to-date European energy policy framework and the global trends in the development of energy technologies. The main priorities in the Energy Strategy are:1) to guarantee the security of energy supply2) to attain the targets for renewable energy3) to increase the energy efficiency4) to develop a competitive energy market and policy for the purpose of meeting the energy needs5) to protect the interests of the consumers'  These priorities also determine the Government's vision for the development of the energy which is :1)maintaining a safe, stable and reliable energy system2) keeping the energy sector a leading branch of the economy with definite orientation to foreign trade3) focus on clean and low-emission energy - from nuclear and renewable sources4) balance between quantity, quality and prices of the electric power produced from renewable sources, nuclear energy, coal and natural gas5) transparent, efficient and highly professional management of the energy companies  The strategy also lays down the main national targets for the energy sector: 16% share of energy from renewables in gross final energy consumption by 2020; 10% share of energy from renewables in the gross final energy consumption in transport by 2020; and energy efficiency increase by 25% by 2020."}
