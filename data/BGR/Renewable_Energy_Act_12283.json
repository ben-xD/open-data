The 2008 Act established support mechanisms that provided for 'equal preferential treatment for producers of electricity (green certificates); mandatory inclusion of utilities generating electricity from RES and biofuels into the national grid; establishing preferential prices for purchasing energy generated from RES (feed-in tariffs); and reducing the administrative burden on producers. The Act resulted in a rapid development of RES (wind and photovoltaic), which put upward pressure on electricity prices. As a result in June 2011 the Parliament adopted the Energy from Renewable Sources Act. The new legislation kept RES preferential treatment options but introduced a preference for energy from biomass and shifted the balance of power from RES producers to grid operators and allowed for a substantial reduction of the prices of energy from photovoltaic (PV)'."}
