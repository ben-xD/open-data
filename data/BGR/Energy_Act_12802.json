In its part on combined heat and power generation introduces the requirements of the related EU directives and the use of instruments such as green certificates and preferential feed in tariffs and mandates the state regulations to the licensed activities in the power sector and purchase obligations for the Transmission and Distribution Companies of all electricity produced from high efficient cogeneration, and for district heating companies to buy all utilised waste thermal energy. The Act also mandates regular production of the National Energy Strategy.
