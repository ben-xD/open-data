The report clearly states that the method for calculation of the energy performance of buildings applied in Bulgaria is based on a European model introduced by a dedicated national standard and supplemented by models that take into account humidity exchange due to the fact that the European model only takes into account apparent temperature, which does not allow the energy necessary for cooling the building in the case of air exchange in the area that is being cooled to be estimated. For the purpose of calculating the cost-optimal levels of the energy performance of buildings and the development of national definitions for buildings with near zero-energy consumption in Bulgaria, the technical regulations adopted in 1999 have been used as a basic standard.

The latest plan is the first to take into account Turkey’s influence on the region. The Turkish system operator forecasts a significant increase of new generation sources (more than 140 GW installed capacity by 2040), along with low prices of electricity and capacity for year-round export. At the same time, the Bulgarian electricity system will rely on investments in new large-scale, zero-emission sources of electricity that are available on a 24-hour basis. This is increase electricity transit flows through the national grid from the East to the West and could create bottleneck at the Bulgarian-Turkish and Bulgarian-Serbian borders, which may jeopardise free trade. Electricity transit through Bulgaria will increase even further following the potential closure of units of the Maritsa Iztok power plant."}, {"text_block_id": "p149_b957", "text": "To ensure safe network operation and its network reliability and sustainability in accordance with the above principles, the following power lines will be constructed:"}, {"text_block_id": "p149_b958", "text": ""}, {"text_block_id": "p149_b959", "text": "400 kV power line from Maritsa substation (Bulgaria) to Nea Santa substation (Greece);"}, {"text_block_id": "p149_b960", "text": ""}, {"text_block_id": "p149_b961", "text": "power line from Plovdiv substation to Maritsa Iztok substation;"}, {"text_block_id": "p149_b962", "text": ""}, {"text_block_id": "p149_b963", "text": "400 kV power line from Maritsa Iztok substation to Maritsa Iztok 3 power plant;"}, {"text_block_id": "p149_b964", "text": ""}, {"text_block_id": "p149_b965", "text": "400 kV power line from Maritsa Iztok substation to Burgas substation;"}, {"text_block_id": "p149_b966", "text": ""}, {"text_block_id": "p149_b967", "text": "400 kV power line from Burgas substation to Varna substation."}, {"text_block_id": "p149_b968", "text": "The interconnecting power lines have been recognised by the European Commission as projects of common interest (PCIs). An in-depth cost analysis has been conducted in connection with their construction in accordance with the ENTSO methodology. The analysis contains an assessment of both economic indicators and technical parameters. The results of the analysis show that in view of the planned development of generation capacity and electricity consumption in the region, the construction of the power lines is justified from a technical and economic point of view. The economic benefits are mainly associated with the expected drop in electricity prices as a result of the removal of barriers to cross-border trade and the decrease in technological transmission costs. The technical advantages of the power lines are related to the improved operational efficiency of the transmission grid, which will be able to rely on uninterrupted supply. This will improve trading conditions and facilitate the procedures for obtaining various documents necessary for the purpose of obtaining construction permits. The electricity system operator has signed financing agreements under the Connecting Europe Facility for two of the abovementioned projects."}], "document_description": "The National Energy and Climate (ENCP) Plan is a ten-year integrated document mandated by the European Union to each of its member states in order for the EU to meet its overall greenhouse gases emissions targets.  The measures of the plan aim : 1) to strengthen policy response and ensure that climate change adaptation is included in the legal framework; 2) to build adaptation capacity and develop financial, social and political guidelines on risk management; 3) to improve knowledge management, research, education and communication with stakeholders.In the context of decarbonisation, the objective is to increase the use of renewable sources in three main sectors which are electric power, transport and energy for heating and cooling.The ENCP set several measures to ensure energy efficiency and security : 1) the diversification of the supply of energy resources; 2) increasing the flexibility of the national energy system; 3) addressing constrained or disrupted supply of energy sources for the purpose of enhancing the resilience of regional and national energy systems; 4) improving interconnectivity and information security (cybersecurity)."}
