Â The measures of the plan aim : 1) to strengthen policy response and ensure that climate change adaptation is included in the legal framework; 2) to build adaptation capacity and develop financial, social and political guidelines on risk management; 3) to improve knowledge management, research, education and communication with stakeholders.In the context of decarbonisation, the objective is to increase the use of renewable sources in three main sectors which are electric power, transport and energy for heating and cooling.The ENCP set several measures to ensure energy efficiency and security : 1) the diversification of the supply of energy resources; 2) increasing the flexibility of the national energy system; 3) addressing constrained or disrupted supply of energy sources for the purpose of enhancing the resilience of regional and national energy systems; 4) improving interconnectivity and information security (cybersecurity)."}
