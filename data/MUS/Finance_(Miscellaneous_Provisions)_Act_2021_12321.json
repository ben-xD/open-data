It amends existing legislation to insert climate-related clauses. It notably 1) grants to the Bank of Mauritius the ability to issue guidelines, directives, rules or instructions regarding the framework for the issue of sustainable bonds, including blue and green bonds (by amending the Bank of Mauritius Act), 2) improves the legal framework to support the production and use of renewable energy sources, including biomass.Â The Prime Minister's budget speech announced a coal use phase-out by 2030, but this is not reflected in the Act itself."}
