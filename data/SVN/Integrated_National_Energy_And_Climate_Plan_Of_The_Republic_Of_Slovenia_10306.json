Although prices are increasingly converging, in the near future there is no expectation of uniform electricity prices in the EU. In the period up to 2030, in addition to emission allowance prices, electricity prices in Slovenia will be influenced mostly by developments in the region. The development of new connections (Slovenia-Hungary, Italy-Montenegro, etc.) and new production capacities will have a significant impact on price developments in the region. We expect electricity prices to fluctuate significantly over time. Although electricity prices are still today determined by the prices of coal, natural gas and emission coupons, renewable (solar) electricity generation has a very significant impact on the hourly rate. It is expected that these impacts (low daytime prices in summer) will continue to increase throughout the EU, a phenomenon on which Slovenia does not have a significant influence. The accelerated construction of solar power plants is changing established practices, leading to the expectation that in summer time Italy will become an electricity exporter, which will have a significant impact on prices in the wider region. Nonetheless, electricity prices are expected to continue rising up to 2030, partly driven by increased demand and accelerated electrification in all areas. In most EU countries, stock market prices do not cover the full costs of production, making investment in new generation capacity difficult. Considering trends in other energy product prices, we expect that average annual baseload electricity prices will fluctuate between EUR2016 57/MWh in 2020 and EUR2016 70/MWh in 2030 (see figure below). The final electricity price is also directly influenced by the State, which takes fiscal and environmental objectives into account when determining the level of taxation on energy products. The price of electricity for the final customer will also be influenced in future by electricity network upgrading needs, especially for distribution networks, and, not least, the increased costs of providing system services (frequency containment reserve (FCR) and automatic frequency restoration reserve (aFRR)) due to the expected increase in the inclusion of intermittent RES in the Slovenian electricity system (EES)."}, {"text_block_id": "p234_b145", "text": "Co-financing the utilisation of wood biomass for energy purposes in industry, DH systems and services is only permissible if, after a preliminary examination of the effects on ambient air pollution, the limit values and targets laid down in the Regulation on ambient air quality are not exceeded."}, {"text_block_id": "p234_b146", "text": "-"}, {"text_block_id": "p234_b147", "text": "High subsidies encourage connection to district heating systems and also the construction of smaller systems (including wood biomass).
