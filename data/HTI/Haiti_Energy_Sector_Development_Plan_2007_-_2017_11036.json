In general, the country has two seasons â¢ wet and dry â¢ where the annual weighted average rain accounts for 1300 (from 400 to 3000)\n millimetres.\n* The Haitian population increased by 22.7% during the period 1990-2004, from 6.486 to 7.959 million inhabitants, leading to an average annual growth rate of 1.56 % over the last fourteen years. Average population density is about 300 inhabitants per square kilometre while in the western part of the country and Port-au-Prince, it exceeds more than double. In rural areas, where 60% of population lives, two third of the workforce is involved in agricultural production. There is considerable additional pressure on the urban areas: the urban population has more than tripled from 1982 to 2003 going from 1.04 million to 3.2 million inhabitants. Overall, the populationâ¢s vulnerability is very high: 65% live under the poverty threshold. The principal health indicators are very alarming â¢ infant and maternal mortality rates remain very high, half of the population does not have access to clean drinking water and only 28% have access to decent sanitation facilities. In terms of active population, the country has sufficient potential labour force as the population of the country is relatively young - 50% of population is less than 20 years old.\n* With an annual per capita GDP of US$ 488.6 in 2005\n* from US$ 635 in 1986-1988, US$ 510 in 1996 and US$444 in 2000), Haiti is the only country on the continent that appears on the list of least-developed countries. Over the past decades, Haiti experienced consequent decline of real per capita GDP with negative average annual growth rates of 2.4% in the 1980s and 2.6% in the 1990s, respectively. Such economic performance was particularly affected by the mismanagement of market liberalization of the 1980s, the military coup of 1991 and the (subsequent) international embargo of the beginning of 1990s, and finally the political crisis that lasts until the elections in 2006. Economic situation in the country is still fragile due to continuing socio-political fluctuation, which adversely effects the rehabilitation and maintenance of economic, social and institutional infrastructure. As the results, the country faces at present, considerable decrease of export revenues from industrial goods, increase of unemployment rates and weakening of tax collection and in turn, the control of public expenditures. Imports are three times higher than exports, counting in 2005 for roughly US$ 1,200 million. Any measures to increase imports for energy purposes should be taken with extreme caution due to low revenues of the population and therefore incapacity to afford.\n* In terms of distribution of GDP by economic activities, service sector accounts 45% share to the total GDP (including 2% of energy) followed by agriculture and mining and construction with 24% and 21%, respectively. Industrial sector appears to represent only 10%.

The government notably seeks to foster renewable energy resources and energy efficiency.\n\nSpecific objectives of the government include 1) support the recapitalisation of companies in difficulties, 2) strengthen the State's regulatory role, 3) improve the conditions for local and foreign investment, and 4) promote alternatives to fuel wood and promote renewable energies including energetic crops and forests.\n\nThe plan further calls for the conservation of natural resources, especially forests. Actions supported include 1) the reforestation of strategic areas, 2) conversion to diesel bio-diesel and to LPG of 1,000 small enterprises that use wood as fuel, 3) financial support to cellulose briquette producers, 4) initiation of a study to determine the feasibility of wood imports or exchanges with lime, and 4) promotion of wind and solar through institutional reinforcement and improved access for the poor to energy services.\n\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>"}
