In addition, it aims to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases. The precautionary principle is a key principle behind the decision to limit emissions. The law is also based on the polluter-pays principle. This Act transposes the EEA legislation.\n\nArt. 42 states that the government must examine the introduction of a tax on fossil fuels (CO2 tax) if the reduction target for CO2 emissions under Article 43 can not be achieved by other measures. Art. 43 states that in a first step, CO2 emissions from the energy use of fossil energy sources are to be reduced by a total of at least 10% by 2010 compared with 1990 levels."}
