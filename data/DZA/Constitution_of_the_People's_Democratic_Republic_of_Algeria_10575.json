It was passed because of civil unrest and a consequential referendum held on 1 November 2020. The referendum text was passed with 66.8% of votes cast from a 23.8% turnout of eligible voters. The&nbsp; Constitution of the People’s Democratic Republic of Algeria is hierarchically above all other laws of the country, safeguarding the individual and collective rights and freedoms. It intends to ensure “the separation and balance of powers, the independence of the judiciary, legal protections, oversight of the work of public authorities, and legal security”.&nbsp;<br><br>Within the preamble, a climate provision recognizes a concern of the effects of climate change, and a subsequent eagerness to take action. It reads as follows: “The people remain concerned with environmental degradation and the negative effects of climate change, and they are eager to ensure protection of the natural environment and the rational use of natural resources in order to preserve them for future generations.”"}
