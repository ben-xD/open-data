In that context, decarbonisation implies several objectives and measures : 1) the reduction of GHG emissions (non-ETS) by 36% compared to 2005, 2) to strengthen and develop public transport, 3) a mobility management for businesses, towns and cities, municipalities, regions and tourism, 4) e-mobility in private transport, 5) to green the standard fuel consumption tax and the engine-related insurance tax, 6) to input tax deduction for electric bicycles and motorcycles. Decarbonisation implies measures in the sectors of buildinds, agriculture, forestry, waste management, fluorinated gases and spatial planning. For the energy, the main objective is to increase the share of renewable energy in gross final energy consumption of energy to 46-50%, and source 100% of electricity consumption from renewables (nationally/balanced).To achieve this goal, the main instrument remains on taxation (tax advantages/exemptions). The plan also aims to ensure measures concerning :  1) the energy efficiency dimension, 2) the internal energy market dimension, 3) the research/innovation/competitiveness, 4) the evaluation and monitoring."}
