Price volatility means fluctuationof revenues, as the hydrocarbon sector is a major source of Qatar’ s revenues (82.4%) 41 and the key development engine.This has been evident in recent years with very volatile oil prices Price volatility during the last two years of NDS-1(2011-2016) was sharper than before, both in levels and in frequency. In 2015, oil prices dropped by 74% lower than theaverage of the period (2009-2014). This sharp decline was accompanied by similar drop in LNG prices, albeit at a lowerrate. Meanwhile, the challenge is not just that these natural resources are vulnerable to price fluctuations, but that theyare also depletable. This price collapse coincided with two important developments with prolonged impact in the future,which makes this challenge chronic. The first was the technological advancement that enabled the economically feasibleextraction of shale oil and gas; thus, continued advancement would further lower production costs and increase oil andgas reserves. This low cost will then be a ceiling for future prices of oil and gas. The second development is the inflation inthe budgets of oil and gas exporting countries, including the increase in Qatar’ s government spending (consumption andinvestment) to meet the development requirements, against decreasing or fluctuating revenues.
