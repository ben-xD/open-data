For this purpose, the decree regulates the production, transportation, storage, and trade of biofuels. It designates the Ministry of Environment, Energy and Telecommunications (MINAET) and the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock (MAG) as the institutions in charge of promoting, implementing and managing the development of the National Biofuels Programme.  According to the decree, prices of raw materials employed in the production of biofuels as well as the sales of biofuels to consumers and to the national oil refinery (RECOPE) are to be determined by the market. However, the prices of fossil fuels mixed with biofuels are regulated by the competent national authority.  The Decree further sets up the National Research and Development Bioenergy Policy to enhance the environmental sustainability of biofuel production, increase production, and support research in new sources of biomass."}
