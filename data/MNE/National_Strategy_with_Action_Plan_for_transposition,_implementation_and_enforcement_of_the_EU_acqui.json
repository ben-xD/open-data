By harmonization with the EU climate and energy acquis Montenegro will be well under its way in implementation of the commitments expressed under INDC. All activities to be implemented by Montenegro in the following period, including harmonization with the EU climate acquis, will predominantly focus on support to the implementation of the Paris Agreement. Montenegro fully understands and recognizes the importance and implications of the Paris Agreement. This understanding stems from the character and the elements contained in the INDC, where major transformational change in sectors of energy production, industry and transport are envisioned to take place by the 2030. Also, the way energy is being used in the domestic and public sector as well in the sector of small and medium enterprises, has to be significantly adjusted in the way it conforms with the prospects of gradual transformation to low-emission development patterns. The other very important issue which Montenegro clearly understands is the necessity to achieve economy-wide and inter-sectoral coordination in achievement of the INDC. In this regard a good basis has been set by establishment of the National Council for Sustainable Development, Climate Change and Integrated Management of Coastal Area, by which the necessary coordination mechanism has been put in place.
