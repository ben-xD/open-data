The guiding principles are: guarantee the protection of the population and of the environment; improve the resilience of the population in cases of risks and catastrophes; and develop conditions to reduce the vulnerability of the population - although there is no explicit mention of climate change adaptation.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;The law provides mechanisms and measures to safeguard hazards and disasters. The strategy for DRC is based on preventive measures, warning, preparation, management, relief, recovery, reconstruction and development.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;The institutional structure for DRM activities includes: the National Council for Disaster Risk Management, a high level co-ordination and strategic decision-making body that is presided over by the Prime Minister and comprised of ministerial representatives; and the National Office for Disaster Risk Management, under the Ministry of Interior. The law calls for the decentralization of DRM responsibilities to the regional, district and commune level.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;The SNGRC is currently being revised."}
