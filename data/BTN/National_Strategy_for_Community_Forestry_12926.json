Quite often, simple procedures are adequate, particularly when management is focused on protection and subsistence use, rather than utilisation of commercially valuable products. Starting with too much prescription and undue complexity and detail can inhibit the efforts of community groups to actively participate in the process and therefore to own the process.

There was also no legal provision for allocation of Government Reserved Forest to communities, though it was an important signalling of the intent to change the forest management paradigm from a centralised top down one to a decentralised and devolved bottom up one. Activities at this time were largely limited to planting free tree seedlings on privately registered land and schools. Real changes began with the adoption of decentralisation policies in the early 1990s when the importance of people’s participation in protection and management of forests was recognised. The decentralised activities included development and management of community and private forest, protection of forest from fire and encroachment into sokshing and tsamdrog, allocation of dry firewood, and sanctioning of subsidized timber for rural construction. Forestry extension units were created in the Dzongkhags with trained Geog Forestry Extension Officers (GFEOs) to assist in the implementation of decentralised forestry activities.

However, in the early years there were severe limitations in the capacity of Dzongkhag Forest Officers to conceptualise the dimensions of decentralised and devolved forest management and to provide the necessary level of support to communities. In addition, the common mind-set of forest officers at all levels was conditioned by training, often in India, to operate within a government directed, centralised and top down approach to forest management. Progress in establishing Community Forests was initially slow for two main reasons: (i) communities were sceptical about whether the Department of Forest would actually hand over Government Reserved Forest for their management and, (ii) government staff had severe reservations about the ability of communities to manage forests sustainably without causing forest loss and degradation (Temphel and Beukeboom 2006).

This might seem only a small amount but is significant in the context that in some communities the cash economy was only introduced recently. Most of the funds are collected through savings, NWFP sale, and fines” (p.5).

Consequently, many of the benefits generated from Community Forests contribute directly to poverty reduction. However, analyses in other countries suggest that there are many distributional issues, with many of the benefits flowing to local elites, and in some cases very poor people are made relatively, if not absolutely, worse off. Furthermore, the human well-being benefits of Community Forestry have frequently been considered in terms of rural livelihoods in general rather than poverty reduction in particular. Though Community Forestry was always linked to poor people, there have been, until recently, few specific strategies that link operational methodologies with poor people’s needs. This is now changing, but empirical examples are few. This is partly because they are so rarely documented and partly because even where evidence exists there are good reasons for thinking that many of the claims about benefits are inconclusive, as they ignore equity aspects and transaction costs (see Boxes 7 and 8) of poor people engaging in Community Forestry programs (Fisher 2000)."}, {"text_block_id": "p53_b471", "text": "Box 7.
