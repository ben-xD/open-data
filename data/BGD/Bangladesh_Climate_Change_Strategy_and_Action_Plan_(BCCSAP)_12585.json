It sets out 44 programmes to be taken by Bangladesh over the short, medium and long term within six strategic areas:<br>&nbsp;- Food security, social protection and health<br>&nbsp;- Comprehensive disaster management<br>&nbsp;- Infrastructure<br>&nbsp;- Research and knowledge management<br>&nbsp;- Mitigation and low carbon development<br>&nbsp;- Capacity building and institutional strengthening<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;A common theme throughout of all of these strategic areas is the focus on the poor and vulnerable and in particular women and children. All programmes are expected to provide synergies with the government's Vision 2021. Examples of the programmes include:<br>&nbsp;- Infrastructure: programme T3P8 seeks to restore rivers and khals through dredging and de-siltation works<br>&nbsp;- Mitigation: programme T5P7 targets re/afforestation"}
