The services sector combines both formal and informal services. It is well known that in countries like Bangladesh and Pakistan, the share of informal services sector is very high.  For example in Bangladesh, it accounts for some 88 percent of all services. The share of informal services in the economies of East Asia, China, Malaysia, Brazil and even India are far lower. The large share of informal services in Bangladesh suggests that the observed high growth in services needs to be interpreted with caution as this may reflect the effect of migration of low productivity agriculture workers to low productivity services. With this caveat, the structure of the Bangladeshi economy resembles strikingly with that of average lower income economies. This is hardly surprising.  Bangladesh, like other low income economies is yet to make the transition to a modern manufacturing and services oriented economy.  The manufacturing share of China, Malaysia and East Asia on average is over 30 percent as compared with a low 18 percent in Bangladesh. Pakistan’s share is slightly higher at 19 percent, but like Bangladesh remains a low industrialized economy.  The cases of India and Brazil, which also exhibit low share of manufacturing require a bit of explanation. Brazil, with a per capita income of $ 4710 in 2009 is in a different league and is already fairly well industrialized with organized services providing the high income jobs and linked to serving the manufacturing sector.  India similarly is fairly well industrialized and its lower share is a reflection of the much faster expansion of export oriented modern services such as Information Technology."}, {"text_block_id": "p400_b1", "text": "4.

The pro-poor policies need to assess why poor households tend to own smaller animals, whether to support such ownership or to relieve constraints to increasing their ownership of large animals. A number of factors determine the livestock ownership pattern of the poor e.g. small animals require less capital to buy and maintain, simplify distress sales, and reduce risks of loss due to death or theft, grow and breed faster, and can thrive on harsher conditions. These issues suggest two major policies to enhance the poverty-reducing role of livestock. First, the focus of livestock research, extension, and public goods provision needs to be directed more towards improving management of small animals in small lots (e.g. better management of infectious diseases). In this context, increasing layered farming of chicken needs to be encouraged. Second, barriers that constrain the poor’s ownership of large animals need to be removed. An important policy approach could be to create institutional arrangements (e.g. through cooperatives or entrusting large animals owners) to perform management, finance, and sale functions of livestock products while ownership rests with small producers. Along with creating new employment opportunities, such policies would provide inputs and services to small herd owners thereby removing critical constraints for them to emerge as profitable livestock farmers."}, {"text_block_id": "p668_b1", "text": "surveys, special surveys and censuses to produce quality data.

Instead, these agents have myopic behaviour. It is a series of static CGE models that are linked between periods by updating procedures for exogenous and endogenous variables. Capital stock is updated endogenously with a capital accumulation equation, whereas population (and total labour supply) is updated exogenously between periods.

With a view to bringing the government owned fallow khas land under forestry coverage participatory social forestation program has been introduced in early eighties. The present government has amended the rules and according to amended rules unlike previous regime only marginal poor are eligible to participate in the program.

Underlying the national poverty story are significant differences between regions. Dhaka, Chittagong and Sylhet divisions in the eastern part of the country experienced rapid poverty reduction between 2000 and 2005. In the West, the gains were much smaller for Rajshahi and nonexistent for Barisal and Khulna. This pattern was substantially reversed over 2005-2010.  Khulna, Rajshahi and Barisal divisions all registered impressive reduction in rural poverty that allowed them to catch up considerably with their Eastern divisions. In contrast reduction in rural poverty reduction was much more modest in Chittagong and Sylhet while it remained stagnant in Dhaka.  These results are partly explained by in-migration from the Western Divisions to the Eastern Divisions, especially to Dhaka, but also reflect gains from policy attention to agriculture and rural development as well as improved road transport linkages between the Western Divisions and the growth centres in Dhaka and Chittagong.  However, the gap in urban poverty between Eastern and Western divisions remain large.  Sustaining and improving the pace of poverty reduction and addressing the constraints faced by economically lagging regions and cushioning therefore remain enduring challenges."}, {"text_block_id": "p415_b45", "text": "2.

Several reasons for leakage were identified which include (i) a flat rate for transportation of commodity @ Tk 250/tonne provided for carrying commodity from food godown to distribution point though it varies from place to place, (ii) no resource is officially allocated to weight and distribute commodity at the distribution point, (iii) Commodity is shared with real deserving non project beneficiary with consent of the project beneficiary (specially in VGD). Despite all this shortcomings FFW probably helps the general poor by keeping food price reasonable.

Other factors related to malnutrition are production and availability of food-grains, level of nutrition knowledge, level of illiteracy and ignorance, poor consumption patterns and lack of diet diversity, distribution of income and food, level of employment, unsafe drinking water and poor sanitation facilities and poor access to and inadequate availability of health services. Good nutrition entails meeting both the dietary energy needs and nutrients for functioning but also increases the immunity to diseases and infections.

One significant feature of urbanization in Bangladesh is that urban population is increasing at different rates in different urban centers. A considerable proportion of urban population lives in district towns and Pourashava areas in Bangladesh. According to population census report of 2001, Dhaka Metropolitan Area had a total population of 10.712 million comprising 37.45% of total urban population. Next in the hierarchy, Chittagong SMA had 3.386 million or 11.84% of the total, followed by Khulna SMA with a total population of 1.341 million or 4.69% of total, Rajshahi SMA with a total population of a 0.70 million or 2.45% of total and Sylhet City Corporation with 0.32 million or 1.12% of the total. All other had below 1% of the total population. Thus, four Metropolitan Areas together with Sylhet City Corporation population comprised 57.55% of the total urban population. There were 33 towns with population above one lac of which 7 had population of above 5 lac, 26 with population between 1 to 4 lac, 50 with population between 50 thousand and one lac, and 116 with population between 25,000 and 50,000 (Table 5.2). There were 332 urban centers with population below 25,000. Populations of many towns were more or less stable and there were depopulation in 15 districts during the decade 1991 and 2001.
