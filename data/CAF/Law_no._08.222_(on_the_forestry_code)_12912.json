It maintains soil fertility, generates many environmental services and contributes to carbon sequestration, survival and well-being of people, including culturally and intimately associated people and wildlife. This Code and its texts establish a legal framework for the management of the forest sector in the Central African Republic. In this perspective, it aims to: 1) reconcile the exploitation of forest products with the requirements of the conservation of forest heritage and biological diversity for sustainable development, 2) ensure the conservation and protection of training for their regeneration, and 3) to ensure the sustainable management of forest ecosystems."}
