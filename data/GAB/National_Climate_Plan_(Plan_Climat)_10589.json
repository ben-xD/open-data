It also provides a national plan to reduce emissions from 'flaring' from gas and oil production, produced in collaboration with the oil sector. The plan promotes increased reliance on domestic renewable energy sources, particularly through the development of hydro-electricity.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;The plan sets the following targets:</div><ul><li>&nbsp;create a sovereign wealth fund</li><li>&nbsp;reduce the volume of waste products flared during oil production by 60% by 2015</li><li>&nbsp;produce a carbon budget each year for all new projects and private enterprises</li><li>&nbsp;produce a national carbon budget every two years</li><li>&nbsp;produce 80% of energy from clean sources by 2020</li></ul>"}
