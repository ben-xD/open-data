1844.&nbsp; The Congress, transformed into a Reviewing National Assembly (Asamblea Nacional Revisora), approved this latest Constitution with 168 votes in favor, one against and 78 absentees. An interesting feature of this Constitution is that its preamble establishes that the Republic is ruled by the supreme value and fundamental principle of, among others, ecological equilibrium. Its climate provision was included within an article that establishes a plan of territorial ordering. This article provides for a territorial order that ensures efficient and sustainable use of natural resources to adapt to climate change. It further states that this is a priority of the State. The article referred to, article 194, reads: “The formulation and execution, through law, of a plan of territorial ordering that ensures the efficient and sustainable use of the natural resources of the Nation, in accordance with the necessity of adaptation to climate change, is a priority of the State”.&nbsp;"}
