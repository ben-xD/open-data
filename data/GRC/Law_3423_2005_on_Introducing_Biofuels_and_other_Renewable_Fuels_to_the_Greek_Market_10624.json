The current law is part of the legal framework on biofuels. It regulates the supply of biofuels in the market and it introduces a national scheme (Biofuels Allocation Programme) that defines the quantities to be allocated to distributors every year. The Programme is in alignment with EU Directives, according to which Member States must adopt national targets which will ensure that a minimum proportion of biofuels and other renewable fuels will be supplied in the market of each Member State. The law also sets the rules so that market competition is guaranteed and biofuels enter the Greek market smoothly and successfully."}
