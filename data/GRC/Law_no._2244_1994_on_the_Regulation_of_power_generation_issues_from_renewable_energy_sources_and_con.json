The Greek Public Power Corporation (PPC) holds the exclusive rights for the production, transfer and distribution of electricity throughout the country. However, the Minister of the relevant department (now the MEECC) can authorise individual producers (natural or legal entities) to produce electricity at power stations which belong to them (as opposed to those which belong to the PPC), introducing thus for the first time an element of energy market liberalisation, applicable for the generation of electricity for installations up to 50MW. These natural or legal entities can either produce electricity for personal use (self-producers) or they can sell it to the PPC (independent producers).<br />\n<br />\nIndividual energy producers can use renewable sources, such as wind power, solar power, biomass, geothermal resources and hydropower. Addressing energy consumption, the legislation adopted a fixed feed-in price for renewables of roughly 90% of the household electricity rate. The law also sets general provisions for the licensing and function of power stations, the pricing of electricity production from individual producers and the technical and economic terms for contracts between individual producers and the PPC. The Centre for Renewable Energy Sources and Saving is set to be the national centre for the co-ordination of all the activities related to renewable sources of energy."}
