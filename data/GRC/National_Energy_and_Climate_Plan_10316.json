As for renewable energy sources, measures for the improvement of energy efficiency are of primary importance for meeting the targets associated with the use of RES in cooling and heating and in transport. As regards security of supply, it is clear that the improvement in energy efficiency and the resulting decrease in demand leads to reduced energy dependency of the country, while measures based on demand response are already in force both for electricity and natural gas. With regard to the aspect of the internal energy market, in the context of the measure for the Development of Energy Transport-Distribution, actions will be implemented for infrastructure managers to improve the energy efficiency of infrastructure, aiming to improve energy efficiency in transport, distribution, load management and the interoperability of networks.
