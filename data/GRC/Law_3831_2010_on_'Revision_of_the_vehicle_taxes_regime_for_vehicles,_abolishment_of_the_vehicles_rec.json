It divides cars into four classes from A (vehicles with the lowest emissions) to D (vehicles with the highest emissions). The revised taxes are based on these four classes and on cylinder capacity. The legislation exempts from annual vehicle taxes privately owned hybrid, electric, and hydrogen passenger cars in classes A and B with capacity lower than 1,929cc. As for A and B class hybrid, electric or hydrogen vehicles with a cylinder capacity higher than 1,929cc, the relevant vehicle taxes are cut by half. Hybrid and low?emission vehicles are also exempt."}
