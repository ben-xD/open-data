It makes energy performance certificates compulsory in all new buildings. Also, for large buildings (exceeding 1,000 total sq. m) under renovation whether to be sold or rented, their energy efficiency is to be upgraded, when it is technically and economically feasible, to the minimum requirements of the energy efficiency regulation set by this law. The law also requires the licensing procedures for buildings to include a study on passive solar system heating/cooling/electricity production systems that uses renewable energy."}
