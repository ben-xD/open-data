To tackle losses generated by climate change, the Strategy first proposes strong participation on international climate negotiations and financial compensation to people and businesses that suffered from climate related disasters. Second, the Strategy outlines that adaptation measures should address urban and coastal changes, the recovery of critical ecosystems and rural landscapes, as well as sectoral adaptation strategies. The third focal area of the NCCS is the development of a mitigation programme that is associated with the national agenda for social and economic development, including the development of a low-carbon economy.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;The Inter-American Development Bank is currently supporting the implementation of the NCCS."}
