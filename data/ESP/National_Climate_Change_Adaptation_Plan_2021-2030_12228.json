This document replaces an earlier version published in 2006 and spanning the period 2006-2020.&nbsp;<br><br>The Plan considers a series of ecological systems and socio-economic sectors for impact assessment, vulnerability studies and adaptation to climate change: biodiversity, hydro resources, forests, agricultural sector, coastal areas, continental hunting and fishing, mountain areas, fishing and marine ecosystems, transport, human health, industry and energy, tourism, financial services, urban planning and construction. The Plan aims to facilitate and to provide continuous assistance to all the interested administrations and organisations - public and private, at all levels, to evaluate the impacts of climate change in Spain in the sector/system of their interest, and to provide all the information available on the subject, and the available elements, tools and assessment methods, for purposes of promoting the process of participation between the ones involved that can lead to the definition of the best adaptation options to climate change."}
