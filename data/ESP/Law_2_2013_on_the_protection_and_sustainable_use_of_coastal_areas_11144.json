A special system for coastal areas at serious risk is introduced, limiting the activities that can be carried out. Management actions should promote protection, preservation or restoration. It requires the evaluation of the possible effects of climate change into projects in coastal areas and includes provisions that projects can be cancelled if they are at risk of sea level rise.\n\nAlongside these legal measures, the Act requires the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Environment to develop a strategy for coastal adaptation to climate change impacts that diagnoses the risks associated with climate change affecting the coast, and measures to mitigate them. This <a href=\"http://www.lse.ac.uk/GranthamInstitute/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Estrategia_Costas.pdf\">strategy</a> has been officially approved by the government on August 18, 2017."}
