It acts as anexecutive agent of the Spanish Science, Technology and Innovation system and is currently attached to the General StateAdministration. It is based in Puertollano (Ciudad Real). This centre contributes to the implementation of scientific advancesachieved by national and international research groups, the diffusion of scientific knowledge adapted for application inuseful technological development and research, along with demonstration of transformation processes using hydrogen asan energy carrier and its final application in possible uses.The Solar Platform of Almeria (PSA): Belonging to the Centre for Energy, Environment and TechnologyResearch (CIEMAT) which is the largest research, development and testing centre in Europe dedicated to solarconcentration technologies. In addition to electricity production, it has a research group dedicated to RDI in the integrationof solar energy into large-scale hydrogen production. The main fields of action in this regard are the development ofprocesses and technologies for decarbonisation and recovery of fossil fuels of low quality, as well as dissociation of waterfor hydrogen production using thermochemical cycles with concentrated solar energy.The National Institute for Aerospace Technology (INTA): This is an autonomous agency attached to theMinistry of Defence, a pioneer in conducting R & D in hydrogen technology in Spain, which has a centre for certification andapproval of automobiles. It has notable experience in: (1) characterisation of low and medium temperature prototype fuelcells (power range up to 30 kW), (2) the design, installation, monitoring and evaluation of demonstrators based on energysystems using hydrogen and fuel cells, (3) national projects (Hercules) for adaptation of conventional vehicles for use withhydrogen fuel cells, (4) other European projects (FEBUS, FCTESTNET and FCTESQA) for the development of standardsand procedures for testing and characterisation of fuel cells in their application to vehicles (cars and buses), (5)development of standards for type approval of refuelling stations for hydrogen through the European projectHyAPPROVAL, in order to standardise approval in the EU, (6) European HyWays project dedicated to establishing aroadmap for deployment of hydrogen as a transport fuel, (7) European EIHP project (European Integrated HydrogenProject) which laid the foundation for the development of Directive 2007/46/EC of the European Parliament and of theCouncil of 5 September 2007 establishing a framework for the approval of motor vehicles and their trailers, and of systems,components and separate technical units intended for such vehicles, as amended by the current Regulation (EC) No79/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 14 January 2009 on the approval of hydrogen-powered motorvehicles.National Renewable Energy Centre (CENER): The CENER-CIEMAT Foundation began its activity in 2002 andits Board is formed by the Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness, CIEMAT, the Ministry of Industry, Energy andTourism and the Government of Navarre.

Four of them will be located in Spain (Zaragoza,Huesca capital Fraga-Huesca, Tarragona), one in Andorra and one in France (Palmiers). These six new hydrogen plants will join thetwo already built in Aragon (Huesca- Walqa Technology Park and Zaragoza-Valdespartera) and the two that are currently being builtin southern France (Rhodez and Albi). Additionally at least sixteen fuel cell vehicles (six cars, eight lorries and two buses) will bedemonstrated to validate the optimal routes and FCEV technology in the area of the Pyrenees., The promoters expect this corridor tobe extended within the framework of other European initiatives. The project is coordinated by the Foundation for the Development ofNew Hydrogen Technologies in Aragon, which will develop a cross-border corridor of hydrogen plants, connecting the regions of thePOCTEFA area to connect with the vehicular hydrogen supply infrastructure established through the development of strategies forsustainable mobility by countries of central and northern Europe where mobility with hydrogen is more widespread.
