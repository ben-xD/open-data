The HBS collects annual information from about 20,000 households. HBS data for the period 2006-2016 were used to estimate AIDS. One of the main limitations of the estimation carried out is the lack of a continuous household survey, since the HBS is a cross-cutting survey for each year; for this reason, the cross-data for each of the years included in the estimation were used, i.e., the data were not transformed into a continuous time series. In estimating equation [1], household expenditure is used as an income proxy because household incomes are underrepresented in expenditure surveys (see for example Wadud et al., 2009 or LópezLaborda et al. 2018) and also because expenditure is a variable closer to permanent vital income and suffers fewer variations throughout the life of individuals (Poterba, 1991). Given that the expenditure groups analysed are made up of different goods and products, the national statistics do not have specific prices for the selected groups, and for this reason it was necessary to construct a price index per group based on the consumer price indices (CPI, INE 2018) of each expenditure subgroup. For this purpose, a Stone Index was constructed for each expenditure group based on the price indices by autonomous community in base year 2006 for each subgroup.
