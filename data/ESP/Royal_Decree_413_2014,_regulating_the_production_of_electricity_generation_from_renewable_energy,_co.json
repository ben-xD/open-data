This payment must allow projects to cover the costs that, unlike conventional technologies, they cannot recover in the market and allows them to obtain a reasonable profit.<br />\n<br />\nRD 413/2014 establishes regulatory periods of six years, with the first regulatory period falling between 14 July 2013 and 31 December 2019. Each regulatory period is divided into two regulatory half-periods of three years. Remuneration parameters can be reviewed at the end of each regulatory half-period or regulatory period, and all remuneration parameters can be modified, including the reasonable profitability for the rest of the regulatory useful life.<br />\n<br />\nRD 413/2014 establishes that new renewable installations may access this remuneration regime bidding in competitive procedures. In off-peninsula systems (the Canary Islands, Balearic Islands, Ceuta and Melilla) investment incentives may be introduced, in accordance with the efficiency of the installations planned for said territories.<br />\n<br />\nOrder ETU/1046/2017 was published as part of BOE no.264 of October 31st, 2017, to notably redefine the scope of previous and new installations and the parameters of redistribution of RD 413/2014."}
