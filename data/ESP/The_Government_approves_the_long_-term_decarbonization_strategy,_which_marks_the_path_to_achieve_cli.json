The remaining 10% will be absorbed by carbon sinks. It is a strategic document that shows the many opportunities for job creation and economic growth. It presents a scenario based on existing technology and knowledge, and offers the signals for investment. The ELP 2050 marks a route that will allow a final consumption of fully renewable energy by the middle of the century, which is meant to increase the competitiveness of the Spanish economy and generate positive effects on health, biodiversity and adaptation to climate change."}
