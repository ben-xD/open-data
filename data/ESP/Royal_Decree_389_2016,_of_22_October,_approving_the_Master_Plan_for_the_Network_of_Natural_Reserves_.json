The Network was previously instated by the Law 30/2014. The Network includes maritime parks. The objective of the Plan is to protect the country's natural systems and ensure as much as possible its protection and conservation. The array of land rules and introduction of formal institutional cooperations include the formal recognition that fossil fuel extraction and hydropower activities are not compatible with the existence, or the project of setting up, a National Park on that same land."}
