Facilitation of air transportation creates additional possibilities for economic development given the existing strict constraints on land transportation. Positive impact on GDP and employment is expected as a result of implementing the newly declared policy, which is mainly due to expected increase in financial resources obtained from tourism. Open air will have positive economic impact on majority of beneficiaries. In particular the new policy in the field will promote incoming tourism and diversification of its geography. On top of that, Armenian Diaspora will have more possibilities to strengthen the ties with the homeland, both by private and business visits.
