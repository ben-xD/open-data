While the index of GDP growth in the economy is 2.57 in 1998-1990, in forestry it is only 1.82. The difference is caused by the fact that the forestry is a primary production sector where the GDP value is created mainly through labour price and capital of products sold on markets. Price of a natural production factor (forest land) is represented in GDP by a relatively small portion from the forest land value, due to undeveloped market with these commodities and prevalence of supply over demand not only in Slovakia, but in all countries in transition and other European countries as well, where relative surplus of wood and wooden products exists. Specific role, however, is also played by the lagging of average quality of products of the wood processing industry in Slovakia, which is rooted in the bad technological equipment, human negligence and insufficient technological discipline.

The Cardiff initiative of the European Council proposed to implement a two-pillar model of sustainable development for the EU, which was in March 2000 at the Lisbon summit extended, adding the third – structural – pillar (socio-economic), in order to ensure integration of environmental policy with economic policy. One year after the Lisbon summit the European Council defined next strategic objective – to introduce a new economy based on higher level of competitiveness and dynamics of knowledge with possibility of sustainable economic growth positively affecting employment and social cohesion. The dimension of the environment was added to this objective at the Stockholm meeting. The Draft Strategy of Sustainable Development: Sustainable Europe for a better world (submitted to the European Council in June 2001 in Göteborg) is oriented to 6 priority issues – climate change, negative impacts on human health, increasing pressures on use of natural resources, poverty and social differences, dynamics of population development and pollution of the environment. Dominant sectors are agriculture, energy, transport, industry and tourism. Their development is not acceptable without taking into account the environmental conditions and viewpoints.

From the point of view of sustainability, the perspective is only to ensure a continual maintenance of monuments with concentrating on conservation of the object of protection and on management of the whole historic environment, especially landscape elements, of which it consists. Rescue activities in cases of threats of liquidation of monuments are not excluded. At the same time the state has to eliminate undesirable trends from the side of owners leading to threatening or even liquidating the values of cultural monuments. Relationship between environmental issues and protection of  the cultural heritage has been stressed in the Constitution of the Slovak Republic (the Act 460/1992), which says that: “each person is obliged to protect and enhance the environment and the cultural heritage”, while “nobody is allowed to threaten or damage the environment, natural resources and cultural monuments over the level laid down by the act”. An important step to creation of systematic conditions for protection of real-estate cultural monuments was adoption of the Act 237/2000, which considerably modified and amended the Act on territorial planning and building code. The Ministry of Culture worked out and submitted for further approval procedure a draft Act on protection of monuments, which brings a number of positive approaches from the point of view of sustainable development and environmental management. This leads to a symbiosis of two sectors (Ministry of the Environment and Ministry of Culture) and to creation of appropriate legal conditions for protection of monuments and landscape management. According to the new Act the role of the Institute for Monuments should be strengthened. Creation of the Authority for Monuments and Regional Authorities for Monuments with more powers is expected. Greater involvement of non-governmental organisations and increase of interests of municipalities in protection of monuments and its use for sustainable development of tourism are also counted on."}, {"text_block_id": "p252_b646", "text": "High quality of human and social resources"}, {"text_block_id": "p252_b647", "text": "– gradual creation and support of healthy, demographically balanced society, assurance of increasing quality of life – social, economic, cultural and spiritual needs with emphasis on problematic groups of inhabitants, elimination of negative social and socio-pathological phenomena;"}, {"text_block_id": "p252_b648", "text": "•"}, {"text_block_id": "p108_b648", "text": "Preparation of the 2000 budget was for the first time based on incomes and not on expenses, as was the practice in the previous period.

This leads to absence of an official programme to support the poor groups of inhabitants. Elimination of poverty is being dealt with in the framework of the social care system. Solution of the poverty problem has to be oriented to social inclusion of the threatened groups into the normal way of life. The decisive role will be played perhaps by the state which should through its social policy prevent the fall of individuals, families and whole groups into the poverty and should help to improve their social situation. The system of social insurance and social aid payments should contribute to this – it is however questionable whether this system is sufficiently motivational at present. It is probable that a part of the poor and socially dependent misuse this system and do not have a real interest to solve their situation.

The dynamics of growth of the foreign debt was increased most considerably in 1996-1997, which was connected to a significant deficit of the balance of payment, which was at low level of foreign direct investments covered in particular by foreign loans.

Of the total number of 2,881 municipalities, there are 2,759 municipalities (96%) members of ZMOS (data of 31 December 1999). Specific problems of cities and their perception as unsolved problems during the first years of ZMOS existence resulted in an initiative of several cities to co-operate and organise outside of this organisation. At the beginning there was a Club of Lord-Mayors and subsequently the Union of Cities of the Slovak Republic. Other unions have appeared within the ZMOS with the aim to deal with specific problems: Union of Historic Cities and Towns and Union of Spa Municipalities. Professional and corporative associations were created in the self-governmental administration (Associations of chairmen of municipal councils, Association of municipal economists, Association of chief controllers of municipalities and Association of public works organisations). Other corporative organisations with relation to political parties appeared (e.g. Association of lord-mayors and mayors).

The ZMOS Council, consisting of representatives of regional unions and being its highest executing body, has established 13 expert working sections, mostly on the basis of sectoral approach. From the point of view of sustainable development it is important that practically all areas are included in the expert sections: regional development, labour and social issues, agriculture, environment, health, economy and privatisation, international affairs. The original ZMOS section of education has been transformed to the Self-government Education Foundation, established by ZMOS. Objective of the Foundation and its 11 regional educational centres is to strengthen quality of local self-governments through activities supporting creativity, effectiveness and ability to respond to the needs of inhabitants and municipalities. The ZMOS representatives are members of almost all important governmental bodies, advisory bodies of ministries and other working bodies. ZMOS is represented in the Council of the Government for public administration, Legislative Council of the Government and in other advisory bodies of the Government. ZMOS, as an organisation of employers, represents interests of self-governments in negotiations with the Confederation of Trade Unions, it is a member of the Council of Economic and Social Agreement and since 1993 it has been a member of the Association of Employer Unions. From the point of view of sustainable development, a special role is played also by the Union of Cities of the Slovak Republic (ÚM SR), which was founded in 1994. Its basic objective is to renew, protect and revitalise the natural and cultural heritage and sustainability of the environment in the cities.
