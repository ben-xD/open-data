This impact is stimulated by crowding out private investment in energy efficiency. Lower private investment will distort the capital in the economy, leading to lower overall production.

These topological changes mean that the total transmission capacity in the import and export directions on this profile may be reduced by approximately 10% of the current maximum value in both directions, as confirmed by the results of the SEPS and ČEPS joint study calculations. One of the main general recommendations of this study for both companies to achieve the greatest reduction in the period with reduced maximum transmission capacity on the CZ-SR profile due to the complete shutdown of the 220 kV cross-border lines, is synchronisation of the planned investment measures of both sides in both material and temporal terms. To eliminate the consequences of reducing the maximum transmission capacity on the CZ-SR profile, by 2025 at the V404 Nošovice (CZ) -Varín (SR) cross-border line the maximum permissible current carrying capacity will increase from 1 740 A to approximately 2 000 A, on the ČEPS side through the complete reconstruction of the line in 2018 and on the SEPS side through the building of a new single 400 kV line between 2024 and 2025. The above planned investments on both sides will not only compensate for the impact of the shutdown of the 220 kV cross-border lines, but will also present the possibility of further increasing the maximum transmission capacity on the CZ-SR profile.
