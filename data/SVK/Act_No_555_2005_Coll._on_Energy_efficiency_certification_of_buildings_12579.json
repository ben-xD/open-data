It defines measures leading to improvement of energy efficiency in buildings with the aim to optimise indoor conditions in buildings and reduce CO2 emissions emitted from maintenance of buildings. It also stipulates the respective competences of public authorities.<br />\n<br />\nThe Act regulates energy performance certificates (EPC) for buildings. The legislative changes set standards for the compilation of EPCs in order to improve their quality. Different energy efficiency categories are designed to help both property owners and purchasers to classify the energetic status of the building, related expenditures for energy consumption and GHG emissions. Buildings that are obliged to provide an energy performance certificate as well as an energy efficiency label include public buildings with a total floor area of more than 250 mÂ² used by a public authority and frequently visited by the public. Energy certification is required for buildings or separate parts of a building that are sold or rented to a new tenant, as well as all newly constructed buildings or all buildings that have undergone major renovation. The Act equally determines the circumstances under which the owners of building or the auditors can be fined."}
