The objective of the Regulations is to reduce GHG emissions by mandating an average 5% renewable fuel content based on the gasoline volume. The Regulations are estimated to result in an incremental reduction of GHG emissions of about 1 MT CO2e per year over and above the reductions attributable to existing provincial requirements already in place. The Regulations fulfill the commitments under the Renewable Fuels Strategy of reducing GHG emissions from liquid petroleum fuels and create a demand for renewable fuels in Canada."}
