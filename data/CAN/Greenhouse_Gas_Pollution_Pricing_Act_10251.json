The price will then stay at C$50 per ton unless new legislation is introduced to revise the price.\n\nAccording to the law, producers, distributors and importers of fossil fuels and combustible waste must register and file monthly reports and returns showing that they have paid the net taxes for the fuels and waste they produce, distribute or import."}
