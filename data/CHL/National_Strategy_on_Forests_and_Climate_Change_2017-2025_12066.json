The platform seeks to reduce the different technical, financial, administrative and institutional barriers to the generation of forestry carbon credits. The Strategy also aims at attracting foreign investment and financial support for the reforestation and forest protection activities through for example the REDD+ mechanism, it also calls for introducing a payment for environmental services (in particular carbon sequestration) of forests. The proposed measures and requirements are expected to be adopted as binding by the proposed Forestry Development Act, currently discussed in the National Congress."}
