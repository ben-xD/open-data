The reform opened up the spot market and guaranteed the right to be connected to the country's power grids to small generating plants, many of which fall into the NCRE category. This move increased commercial and generating opportunities for these small producers.<br />\n<br />\nIn addition, the reform exempted projects using NCREs from paying transmission fees, using a differentiated scaleâ€”one for plants generating up to 9 MW and another for those generating between 9MW and 20MW. In addition to benefiting those sources, this exemption serves to recognise a positive externality, given their low impact on transmission grids and on invest-ments associated with their expansion."}
