It aims at enhancing the union's climate targets and sets four core goals: 1) climate-neutrality by 2050, 2) protection of human life, animals and plants by cutting pollution, 3) helping companies become world leaders in clean products and technologies, and 4) help ensure a just and inclusive transition. These goals should be reached by developing a circular economy, decarbonising the energy sector, renovate buildings, support the industry to innovate, and green private and public transport systems."}
