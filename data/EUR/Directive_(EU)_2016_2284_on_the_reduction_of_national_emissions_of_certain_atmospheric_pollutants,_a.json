It amends Directive 2003/35/EC and repeals Directive 2001/81/EC. The document focuses on sulphur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOC), ammonia (NH3) and fine particulate matter (PM2.5).&nbsp;<br><br>The document mentions that the document should contribute to achieving, in a cost effective manner, the air quality objectives set out in Union legislation and to mitigating climate change impacts in addition to improving air quality globally and to improving synergies with Union climate and energy policies. Financial dispositions as well as reviewing of air quality policies must therefore be climate-sensitive."}
